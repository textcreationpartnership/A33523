         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His learned Treatiſe hath met with many hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances and difficulties attending its coming forth into the world. Firſt, through too ſlow a Midwife, it hath ſtuck too long in the birth; and for two years ſpace been ſhut up in darkneſſe, as if unworthy of Publique light: Then, in the delivery of it in the <hi>Preſſe</hi> it had received too many bruiſings through miſtakes, as this catalogue of <hi>Errata's</hi> collected by the Author himſelf nine Months ſince doth witneſſe. And after all, it was in danger to have come firſt abroad, like ſome illegitimate birth, without a Parents bleſſing with it: The Title and Preface prefixed by the Author, giving light and luſtre thereunto, being for a while miſſing, and thought utterly loſt; but juſt as it was a coming forth found and recovered again.</p>
            <p>But Reader, though it be (as <hi>Paul</hi> complains of himſelf) Thus <hi>born out of time,</hi> and comes forth <hi>laſt</hi> in compariſon of many other Treatiſes upon this argument; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think, (when I conſider the weight and ſolidity that is in it) That God hath in a wiſe diſpoſure reſerved it laſt as a Coronis to all the former.</p>
            <p>It is often ſeen in Perſons, (and ſo why not the like in the Writings and Works of Perſons?) that are deſigned by God to greateſt uſe, That in their births or fore-part of their lives, they have been clouded with obſcurity, and environed with ſad diſaſters in their emergency into the publique.</p>

            <p>Thou that art a ſerious intelligent Reader, and a ſearcher of the Truth in this great controverſie, read and peruſe it: And let theſe <hi>Errata's</hi> be ever and anon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by thee, if thou at any time art at a loſſe for the Authors meaning.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the unhappineſſe of our age, That old rotten Errors are even raiſed out of their Sepulchres, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently avowed Truths become the ball of contention. Nor is this any new thing, that when any glorious Work of Reformation is attempted in any place, that it ſhould be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſome ſuch incumbrances. If <hi>Nehemiah</hi> will build for God, he need not wonder if he finde or meet with much rubbiſh. <note place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> It's an old trick of the Dragon, to watch when the Woman clothed with the Sun, adorned with the twelve Stars, and treading the Moon under her feet; is in pain of travail, and ready to be delivered: that if it may be, he may devour the childe; or if woman and childe eſcape his throat, yet to pour out floods of Satanicall Doctrines, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on with the Dragons ſubtilty, if that way poſsibly both may be deſtroyed. In which caſe, whatever the whole earth can afford, it would not be denyed. It's a moving ſpeech
<pb facs="tcp:41963:4"/> of <hi>Solomon</hi> in another caſe; <note place="margin">Prov. 24.</note> 
               <hi>If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn to death, &amp;c. If thou ſayſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we knew it not, doth not he which pondereth the heart conſider it, &amp;c.</hi> Me thinks too great a portion of the profeſsing part of our dear native Countrey, are even ready to be ſlain, they are drawn to a worſe death then that of the ſword: <note place="margin">Rev. 9.</note> There are killing waters, and killing words. Falſe Teachers may indanger the life of ſouls; <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 9</note> and it's ſad to be ſtarted from that reſt of wearyed ſoules, the Word; <note place="margin">Ezek. 13.</note> then a man, is like a bird flying from bough to bough, not knowing where to reſt: <note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> They are hunted ſouls cauſed to fly. <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> It may be ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of the truth, never eſtabliſhed: And where ſhould ſuch reſt, which are, as it were, out of their proper place, diſcentred?</p>
            <p>For my own part, I profeſſe my ſelf to be ſlow of ſpeech to utter, and ſlow of heart to apprehend; and therefore not to be nimble enough for ſuch a reſcue of hunted ſouls. Yet being rowſed up by Neighbouring Elders, together with other Brethren, and my heart having been long troubled much to ſee and heare of the miſchiefs of corrupt Opinions, and amongſt others of that of <hi>Anabaptiſm:</hi> I have not been unwilling, if I might hope to doe any ſervice to Chriſt by debating, detecting, and diſproving thereof, at leaſt to endeavour the ſame. I remember him that ſaid, <note place="margin">1. King. 8.</note> 
               <hi>It was well it was in thy heart to build my Houſe.</hi> There are many abler and better hands at work, I hope, in that Cauſe of the Foederall and Church-right of the children of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which are in viſible politicall Church eſtate; but being ſo much urged upon it, I cannot but fall to work with ethers, and helpe to dig up the old Wels of <hi>Abram,</hi> which ſome (although not <hi>Philiſtims</hi> I hope many of them; yet verily in this matter they act a <hi>Philiſtin</hi>-ſpirit) have, at leaſt, attempted to ſtop: and it may be they will not ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:41963:4"/> the ſervants of God to dig them up in quiet. But, I hope, Chriſtian Reader, thou wilt take acceptably endevours from the weakeſt and unworthyeſt of the Laborers of God in ſo neceſſary a work at this time. I have endevoured in what I have attempted this way, to ſtand, as they ſometimes did, with Trowell in one hand, and Sword in the other at once, to build on for God and his people, and to beat off ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Tenents as would undermine the Work. <note place="margin">Nehem: 4.</note> Chriſt himſelf was ſtirred in the Cauſe of the Children of pious minded perſons, and why ſhould not every one which loveth him be moved too therein? Suppoſe ſome who would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the approach of ſuch Babes to Chriſt for his bleſsing, are otherwiſe precious men and godly, yet herein they are to be chidden and withſtood. It's not the firſt time that Satan can prevail, even with <hi>Peter,</hi> to give dangerous counſell: He can now ſtirre up in farre better men an <hi>Amalekite</hi>-like ſpirit to hinder the weakeſt, and ſo the younglings of <hi>Iſraels</hi> camp at their firſt entrance unto the Mount of God, where he appointed to be more ſolemnly worſhipped.

                     <p>ERe we launch into this deep, ſo variouſly coaſted and ſounded, let us premiſe ſome few things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the perſons moving this ſcruple, were not perſons then to marry, as if that were inquired: whether it were meet for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving party to match with an Infidell, forbidden 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. but they were parties actually married, husband and wife.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That ſuch as moved the caſe, were not couples whereof both were Infidels, and out of the Church: nor yet both viſibly beleeving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41963:8"/> and in Church-fellowſhip: but perſons unequally yoaked; one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Chriſtian, and of the Church: the other Infidell, Pagan, and without.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it was not the caſe properly and originally of the whole Church, but of ſome members in it, like as the former caſes about perſons which were to marry were the caſes onely of ſome.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the ground of the beleeving parties ſcruple touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in a conjugall way with their Infidell Yokefellowes lay in their perplexing feare, leſt their ſoules might come to bee thereby polluted; as having fellowſhip with ſuch whoſe unbeleefe of it ſelfe tended to make ſuch a courſe in it ſelfe lawfull to become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. and 21. 4. And ſome other way they doubted they might runne hazard of participation and reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of guilt by intimacy of Communion, as <hi>Nebem.</hi> 13. 25, 26. or the like.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ingaged and imbarqued themſelves in this caſe of ſome of their particular members, ſo farre as to write for ſatisfaction about it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. compared with Chap. 7. 1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That by the words foregoing, husband, wife, is intended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beleeving parties, whether husband or wife: and that alſo they were conſidered in this paſſage, of ſuch, as to, in, or by whom the Infidell parties were ſanctified, not meerely as husbands and wives, but as beleeving. The former I thinke none will deny: For what had the Church to do with thoſe couples whereof both were without? or what likelihood was it, that Pagan couples ſhould ſcruple ſuch abode upon any ground of pollution of conſcience, which they feared? Beſides, the occaſion of this <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band having ſuch a wife is expreſly called a brother, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. in the reſolution of the matter in caſe of wilfull rejection, what liberty may be taken: The parties chiefely intereſſed, are called by the name of brother and ſiſter. The ſecond is as evident, that in this caſe, they are conſidered as beleevers, both by the oppoſition of them to the unbeleeving parties, in regard of whom they ſcrupled pollution: and in that that being ſanctified, is not appropriated in any way of efficiency to the unbeleevers; thus. The wife is ſanctified to, in, or by the unbeleeving husband, or the husband is ſanctified, to, in, or by the unbeleeving wife; as if the unbeleeving party were chiefe in this; but contrariwiſe, rather the unbeleeving husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in, to, or by the wife, &amp;c. Finally, when in the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41963:9"/> caſe is underſtood of a perſon, which is as well a beleever, as an husband or wife, by whom it's ſaid the other infidell party may come to bee ſaved, yet that party is barely named wife or husband, not beleeving wife or husband; will any now ſay, that there can be no other reaſon thereof rendred, but this; that albeit the party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended were both an husband or wife, and a beleever: yet in that particular the party is conſidered, not as a beleever, but as an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife? I ſuppoſe here the abſurditie would bee ſo groſſe, that none would owne it, no more let any truely judicious ſpeake that way of that here mentioned; the unbeleeving husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by, or to, or in the wife.</p>

Nor is it meant barely, being made a lawfull husband or wife, of whom the other party might make lawfull uſe: <hi>John Spilsbury</hi> is right in that: That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> never ſcrupled that, but that marriage fellowſhip was honorable, and the bed undefiled. This was ſo, to and among all, Pagan or Chriſtian, equally or unequally yoked in the dayes of the Author to the Hebrews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. This was no ſuch puzling caſe, that they need write to an Apoſtle ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly about it from learned <hi>Corinth,</hi> where they had ſo much, if not too much civill and common Law. And to what purpoſe were it to make ſo narrow a Plaiſter, as that of civill lawfulneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall uſe to ſo broad a ſore, as a troubled conſcience: knowing, that many things may be by civill Lawes lawfull, yet tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences dare not take libertie to make uſe thereof accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome Lawes, even amongſt Gods people, were made rather for their hardneſſe of heart, as that of divorce, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 8. then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; yea this was to give Phyſick which did not ſuite with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41963:9"/> malady: The <hi>Corinthians</hi> not being troubled about the matter of lawfulneſſe of marriage fellowſhip. That bed was to all <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as well as others, counted in it ſelfe undefiled. But rather, whether that uſe was ſanctified to them; ſo, as that which was in it ſelfe lawfull, did not by the Infidels ſinne become defiled, yea, ſo farre, as that they partaking with them in that marriage uſe, ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with them in ſome defilement of conſcience. The Apoſtle when ſpeaking to the caſe as beleevers were Intereſted in it, hee ſaith more in that, the unbeleeving husband or wife is ſanctified to the other party; then thus: that ſuch become lawfull husband or wife to ſuch, or their conjugall uſe lawfull. Beleevers in all lawfull things have all which others have, <hi>ſcil.</hi> lawfull uſe thereof: as men: but they have more then any unbeleeving Infidell perſons have, or can have, whilſt Infidell, even a holy uſe thereof alſo as beleevers; To the pure all things are pure: <hi>ſcil.</hi> not onely lawfull, for ſo meate, and drinke, and phyſick, and marriage, &amp;c. are to others, but holy in and for the uſe thereof: Each one which hath a lawfull uſe of a perſon or thing, hath not therefore an holy uſe thereof. To the impure and unbeleeving many things, as plowing, apparell, conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall cohabitation, &amp;c. are in themſelves lawfull, yet nothing is pure to them, but their conſciences are defiled in the uſe thereof, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 4. whether the promiſe give right to ſuch and ſuch bleſſings, or no, or whether ever the bleſſing of the bleſſings bee pleaded for in prayer, or no, men may have a lawfull uſe of their meate and ſleep, &amp;c but ſuch have the holy uſe, or every thing is ſanctified to ſuch by the word and prayer, which improve the ſame for that end, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. for ſo hee giveth meate to them which feare him, as mindfull of his covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 5. and ſo hee giveth his beloved ſleepe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 2.</p>
                     <p n="8">The eighth and laſt thing premiſed is, that the Apoſtle in the Argument which hee uſeth here to confirme that of ſuch yokefel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, being thus ſanctified to, or by the beleeving parties, hee changeth the perſon, from the third to the ſecond: as concerning and nearely touching the body of the Church collectively; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as were parents and had children.

                     <p>Nor by holy, is meant ceremonially holy; of which holineſſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, as is evident by the mention of the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall meanes of ſprinkling of bulls and goats blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would ſeeme to draw as if intended of outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe now viſible to the Church, when it's evidently ſpoken of that branch of Jewiſh ceremoniall holineſſe now abrogated.</p>
                     <p>Nor by holy, is meant here perſons which poſſibly may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; but this is but a may bee in reſpect of all ſuch children: whereas the Apoſtle ſaith peremptorily, they are, not they may bee holy.</p>

Thus, if you divorce your yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows, you muſt put away your children alſo, as they did, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 44. And <hi>Hen. Denne</hi> maketh the meaning of your children are holy, to be the ſame with the unbeleeving husband or wife is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41963:11"/> 
                        <hi>ſcil.</hi> They are not to be put away. Whereas the immediate connection of this clauſe to that paſſage, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. in way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and not to <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. ſheweth it to be a reaſon of the former, not of the other in <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. The caſe of putting away came in queſtion, but as a ſuppoſed remedy of pollution of conſcience by conjugall communion: the unlawfulneſſe of which remedy, being ſo expreſly mentioned, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. 13. and confirmed by foure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17. there needed no more weight put there. But ſince the feare of pollution of conſcience, did occaſion that caſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. and that feare is ſo fully taken off in the firſt of the 4 reaſons againſt ſuch putting away mentioned in the former part of the 14 <hi>verſ.</hi> meet it was to ſtrengthen that reaſon in eſpeciall: which ſo directly met with the bottome ſcruple, as it was in this very clauſe, <hi>Elſe, &amp;c. but now, &amp;c.</hi> And to imagine this to bee the Apoſtles inference: If you put away husbands or wives, you muſt put away children too, &amp;c. ſuppoſeth an Apoſtle to reaſon imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently and unſoundly, ſince in the caſe of divorce of ſpouſes, it doth not neceſſarily follow, that the children begotten of them bee alſo put away.</p>
                     <p n="1">For 1. even in lawfull divorces for adultery, no word of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning childrens being put away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. nor was it ſo practiced: the husband need not own his wives baſtard indeed, as his other children, but muſt own thoſe begotten of his own wife before her divorce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The children lawfully begot, partaking of the believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as well as Pagan; Reaſon will plead as ſtrongly with nature, and more ſtrongly with grace in the divorcing party, putting away the other when deſirous to abide, <hi>verſe</hi> 12, 13. that the children are rather to be detained by the beleeving party, as ſuppoſe the father, &amp;c. for higher and holyer ends, then by putting them away to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their owne childrens ſoules welfare.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If there had been any weight in their feare of pollution, by retaining the infidell yoke-fellow, yet no colour of pretence of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of conſcience, by retaining their little ones; whom they might better ſeaſon with their owne Chriſtianiſme, then feare being leavened by their paganiſme, or the like. There needed not therefore any ſuch ſuppoſed remedy of pollution, by removing their children alſo. As for that parallelling of that, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10 44. with this caſe, it is very unſuitable; That was a caſe of perſons inchurched having an expreſſe prohibition to the contrary, not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41963:11"/> to joyne with ſuch, as perſons betwixt whom and themſelves, there was a partition wall yet doing it. This is a caſe of perſons, all of one ſort Pagan, when firſt married, and under no ſuch prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; onely after they were married one partie embraceth the faith: now to make the intervening of grace as a ſole occaſion of ſuch breakings of families in pieces were ſad and ſcandalous: yet to ſuppoſe Pagans to be under ſuch a prohibition, as the Jewes to match with Pagans, had been to make them wholly prohibited marriage at all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Others expound it onely of legitimacy or illegitimacy of the children in reference to the lawfulneſſe or unlawfulneſſe of the ſpouſes, ſome, as <hi>I. S.</hi> conſider the beleeving ſpouſe, as ſuch, in both effects of the ſpouſe being ſanctified unto them, and the childrens being holy, or lawfull producing, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. To the pure all things are pure, or lawfull uſe, as hee expounds it. Others of whom <hi>Beza</hi> ſpeaketh in his notes upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. extend it to the children of both parents Infidell: that they are not ſpurious, but legitimate, which he refuteth from the ſuppoſition of the Apoſtle. For wherefore, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> ſhould hee diſcourſe of baſtards, or of both ſpouſes Infidell? which makes me the more wonder at <hi>Beza</hi> as quoted by ſome for matrimoniall ſanctitie, as here underſtood, if taken of civill ſanctitie or lawfulneſſe, <hi>Beza</hi> profeſſedly diſclaimes it, for ſaith hee, the Apoſtle diſcourſeth not of civill policy, but touching conſcience. And I grant, ſaith he, that the marriage of Infidels is civilly lawfull: It's not fornication before God. But what is this to <hi>Pauls</hi> ſcope, diſcourſing touching conſcience? and <hi>Beza</hi> profeſſedly argueth againſt any ſuppoſall, that becauſe the beleeving party is not mentioned, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. yet that therefore not underſtood in the preſent caſe as ſuch, as ſome expound this place, which yeeld that he ſpeaketh of perſons, one a beleever, the other infidell, but ſay, that in this caſe, hee conſiders not the perſon as a beleever, but as any other lawfull man or wife. This <hi>Beza</hi> by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument refuteth. <hi>C. B.</hi> hee ſeemeth to propend to this later expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the Apoſtle conſiders them not here, as one a beleever, the other not, but meerly as husband and wife.</p>
                     <p>As for the conjecture of <hi>I. S.</hi> it hath already appeared, that, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. intends more then a bare lawfull uſe, common to all Infidels, as the oppoſition ſheweth. [But to the unbeleeving is nothing pure when yet many things are lawfull. And ſo here, when the Apoſtle ſpeakes of perſons as ſuch, one whereof is a beleever, in,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41963:12"/> and to whom the other is ſanctified, hee intends more then a bare lawfull husband or wife to them; and for their children alſo more then civilly legitimate. And it were too abſurd in an Apoſtle, to lay that for a cauſe of legitimacy which is not: But Gods ordinance rather, not faith, Pagans marriages being as lawfull as Chriſtians. And it were abſurd to reaſon: That unleſſe one bee a beleever, the children are baſtards, when the children of each man and wife, Pagan or Chriſtian, are as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> which herein were radically conſidered in reference to all ſuch like couples, ſuch whoſe children are a ſeed of God, or of his inſtitution, in generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. truly proveth. This was unheard of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 14. and tended rather to deſtruction in all families, where ſuch doctrine ſhould come, then to peace. And if there had been any ground of ſcruple in theſe caſes of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely as man and wife, what need they trouble Apoſtles with ſuch civill caſes? or what hath Chriſt and his Diſciples; as ſuch, to doe in civill matters? <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. The Apoſtles would not bee cumbred with Table-ſervice, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 4. much leſſe with the civill law intricacies.</p>
                     <p>And whereas <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. is urged as a proofe by ſome; it proveth that which was not queſtioned, <hi>ſcil.</hi> legitimacy of children of any lawfull man and wife, but diſproveth ſuch a Tenet, that unleſſe the couples bee one or both Inchurched beleevers as were theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. their children are not a ſeed of God, a legitimate ſeed. In that God eyed all the ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> as conjugally united in the ſame common reference, as of duties in common, of love, care, &amp;c. in the husband and ſubjection in the wife, and fidelitie in both; ſo in this fruit of ſuch lawfull conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall fellowſhip, legitimacy of children; wherein both parties, as lawfull man and wife, have equall ſhare, without any ſuch peculiar beleeving Covenant and Church reſpect, as any Inſtrumentall cauſe thereof, whereas the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a caſe of holineſſe of children, ariſing from ſome peculiar conſideration of ſome one parent and not the other, or if of both, yet not of both in that common way of meere civill lawfulneſſe of matrimony, but with peculiar reference to an inſtrumentall cauſe of an higher nature.</p>
                     <p>And ſo wee come to the other opinion, to which anſwer is made, in the ſixth and ſeventh conſiderations before mentioned: as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of Inchurched parents, at leaſt one of them, ſo he conſidereth them at leaſt (as) Eccleſiaſticall beleevers, viſibly in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41963:12"/> Covenant with God &amp; his people, and holding forth faith in God, and in his Covenant, (as) beleeving brethren and ſiſters, and not barely as lawfull man and wife, as the context and proofes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly urged declare. But let us heare the reaſons, why meant of them as man and wife, and not as beleevers in the caſe propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

                     <p>But to come to the matter propounded. We will ſuppoſe it meant of matrimony, which as Gods ordinance is a certaine cauſe as of legitimacy of the husband to marriage uſe, ſo of the children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in, and by marriage fellowſhip. This you will ſay will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all ſides. But will it indeed? Is it certaine, all married peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould have children? Is it not a very contingent effect? how can you reaſon from cauſe to effect rationally? Are not many married perſons paſt having of children by each other? or natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſabled from generation? what ſatisfaction is it to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to tell them of an effect ſo unlikely, and naturally ſo unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? All will anſwer here, yea, but in the nature of the ordinance, it is ſuch a cauſe tending by Gods appointment to ſuch an effect: and <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> ſuppoſing the object to bee qualified with that effect of legitimacy, <hi>ſcil.</hi> children actually begotten by marriage fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then the effect is not contingent, but alwayes followeth. And all married perſons may bee incouraged to their condition, in that the ordinance hath not influence alone upon the ſpouſes in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their marriage-fellowſhip, but upon ſuch children as God pleaſeth to beſtow upon married perſons, for that both became lawfull, and not unlawfull. As much ſay I in this caſe. That a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man in covenant with God and his Saints, hee by improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods word, &amp;c. hath this certaine to him, and for his incouragement, whether hee ſtand in relation to a ſpouſe onely, and have yet no children, yet hee hath a ſanctified uſe of his ſpouſe: or if God make his ſpouſe fruitfull, hee hath a ſanctified uſe of her, yet further in a reference to any child by her, to which hee ſtands in relation as a parent; That as another effect of the covenant improved, and of faith alſo therein, hee hath this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of a Federall and Eccleſiaſticall condition of his child,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41963:14"/> and this is a comfortable incouragement to all ſuch perſons, that there is ſuch an influence of the word of God improved by faith, that as marriage-uſe is ſanctified by it: ſo children begotten in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are Eccleſiaſtically and Federally holy; when the Apoſtle ſaith, All things are pure to the pure, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. and every creature is ſanctified by the word and prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. hee doth not thereby weaken or falſifie the ground-worke from cauſe to effect, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their comfort thence; becauſe it may bee ſaid, it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, yea impoſſible, that one beleever ſhould have all things or creatures, &amp;c. but it ſufficeth <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> what ever hee hath more or leſſe, its pure to him: And if hee have any thing more, which he had not, that then it becomes actually pure to him, ſo in this caſe: Therefore the Apoſtle doth not reaſon thus, elſe you ſhould have no children, but ſuppoſing you have children, it would follow they were elſe uncleane, but now they are holy.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus removed and cleared ſuch miſtakes in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this Text, we come now to what I conceive to take up the full meaning of what is ſaid of theſe children of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Church-members, that they are holy. Some take it of Federall holineſſe, ſome of Eccleſiaſticall and Church-holineſſe: I would exclude neither: It being ſpoken of the children of parents in ſuch ſort in the Covenant of Grace, as it is inveſted with Church-Covenant alſo, explicit or implicite, and in the ſame reſpect the children are Federally holy, as the Covenant of Grace is cloathed with Church-Covenant in a Politicall viſible Church-way.</p>
                     <p>And thus I conceive of the Apoſtles inference and argument [elſe your children were uncleane, but now they are holy] <hi>Scilicet,</hi> That unleſſe your Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, which you hold forth, and your faith therein, which you in a Church-way profeſſe, have ſo much influence upon your yokefellowes, as to ſanctifie them in, and to, your conjugall uſe: But that there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validitie and privation of influence thereof, in that your conjugall relation; then muſt you be as well to ſeeke of any validitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in another relation alſo: <hi>ſcil.</hi> in your parentall relation to your children: even there alſo, ſhall the covenant, and faith have no influence unto ſuch an effect of holineſſe of your children. If they produce not ſuch an effect in the former, by which yet the Infidell partie have no perſonall priviledge, how will they produce the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which children have according to you an unqueſtioned perſonall priviledge, that they are holy? hee that will queſtion, or caſt off the force of ſuch inſtruments influences in one thing, hee by the ſame diſtemper, will caſt the ſame off in another. Yea, if it be groundedly and really for that the Covenant of Grace which beleevers lay hold of together with their faith therein, have no effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in one condition, or relation, it is as well true in another, only reſerving the diverſitie of influences, as diverſly elicited or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. If they are not effectuall to produce ſomething peculiar to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41963:15"/> beleevers in a conjugall relation differing from all Pagan ſpouſes, they will neither produce any thing peculiar to them in a parentall relation to their children. But as your ſpouſes ſhall bee to you as all other pagan ſpouſes, in common to each other: meerely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to uſe, ſo your children, with, and to you ſhall be in your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentall relation, but as pagan children are uncleane or profane, which to all were abſurd: But now, rather they are holy; namely, Federally, and not as other Pagans children, profane. Now, when I mention in this expoſition the Covenant, as in part having ſome influence in both relations, as well as faith, I doe it, as not daring to ſever faith from the word of faith, which even giveth ſtrength to faith it ſelfe: And beſides, God having made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with his ſpirituall ſeed in their Generations, as well as with the Jewes: And that in ſuch ſort alſo, as with reſpect to Church eſtate, and as inveſted with Church-Covenant, hence it is, that the [meere] Infidelitie of a Pagan ſpouſe abiding Pagan when the other comes to the faith, ſhall not hinder the courſe and force of Gods Covenant to In-Churched beleevers ſeed, witneſſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample both of the ſon of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4. 24. &amp;c. and of <hi>Eunice, Act.</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3. even many perſonall ſinnes of the Saints hinder it not, much leſſe doe other perſonall ſinnes evacuate the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Hence, ſo long as this Covenant-Intereſt holdeth in force, that either it be not rejected by the parents, as it was by thoſe Jewes <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. or that they be not juſtly, for covenant breaches di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyled of Church benefit by it by ſome Church-cenſure, ſo long the covenant is Eccleſiaſtically of force to the childrens federall &amp; Church-eſtate. So in the caſe of thoſe Idolatrous Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, being not diſcovenanted, and diſcharged by Gods hand, or by Eccleſiaſticall authoritie, their children were federall, and Church-ſeed, the Churches children borne by her unto God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. 20, 21, 23. compared. That holy Covenant produceth that reſpect of holy perſons, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 24. compared with 11. 28. 30. 32. Hence the Covenant and Church-eſtate of Covenant and In-chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched parents, is firſtly the parents priviledge, and ſo to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Hence alſo I conclude then that the little ones of viſible beleeving and In-churched parents, ſuch as theſe mentioned in the Text were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1, 2. with 1. and 14. they are Federally and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtically holy. In this ſenſe the word holy is frequently uſed, yea, of many perſons, which were neither inherently holy, nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41963:16"/> imputatively holy in a ſtrict ſenſe, no nor ſo much outwardly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in point of lively expreſſions of perſonall holineſſe, yet are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led holy, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Eccleſiaſtically, and in externall reſpect to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that not a Covenant of workes, for that calleth no ſinners holy, nor by any meere ceremoniall holineſſe, but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 2. They are called the holy ſeed, and the ſame phraſe in the ſame Covenant and Church reſpect, is in Scripture frequently uſed, with reſpect to ſuch Infants, the holy people deſtroyed by <hi>Antiochus, Dan.</hi> 8. 24. were the Jewiſh children as well as growne perſons. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were a part, and a ſpeciall part, of that choſen, beloved, and people redeemed from <hi>Egypt,</hi> which were called holy.

They were children of the Church, and borne to God, as husband to the Covenant Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. 20, 21. 23. compared with <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2. &amp; 3. 1. and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54. 4, 5. nor was this as I intimated a ceremoniall matter, no more then either <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant was with ſome which oppoſe us confeſſe did belong in ſpeciall ſort to the Jewes, and that Covenant was the very Covenant of Grace, and therefore that did by this grant in ſpeciall wiſe belong to them, nor was it more ceremoniall, then was that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. 11, 12, 13, 14. which the Apoſtle maketh the very doctrine of faith, which they preached, as by comparing that with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. wee ſhall God willing declare.

Secondly, ſuppoſing the promiſe to bee of a ſaving grace, of Chriſt ſent, of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinance of baptiſme, of the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.

To like purpoſe <hi>A.

But thoſe that are afarre off, are not in the Covenant by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, untill they beleeve; therefore, neither thoſe children; which hee further confirmeth, that if then they were in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thou had they been alſo of the Church of the Goſpel: But that they were not of: For it's ſaid afterwards, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. that they were added to the Church, as many as beleeved, and therefore were not of it before. <hi>C.

                     <p>COme wee then to the firſt opinion, touching the words.

Secondly, it is ſending of Chriſt, or of Chriſt ſent. But let it bee conſidered. 1. That the Apoſtle doth not ſay, the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>omiſe was to you, as in reference to the time of making it to the fathers, with reſpect unto them, or in reference to Chriſt, who was not now to come, but already come, as the Apoſtle proveth, from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to 37. nor is it the uſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when mentioning promiſes as fulfilled, to expreſſe it thus in the preſent tenſe: the promiſe is to you, or to ſuch and ſuch, but rather to annex ſome expreſſion that way, which evinceth the ſame, for which let <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Nehe.</hi> 9. 8. 23. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 15. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 56. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16, 17. 33. and 13. 32, 33. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21. 45. and 23. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 22, 23. and 21. 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 54, 55. 68, 69. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26, 27. be conſidered. 2. They knew already to their coſt, that Chriſt indeed was ſent amongſt them, and to bee that Jeſus or Saviour of his people from their ſinnes, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 36, 37. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. And this was cold comfort to them, to tell them of that which wounded them, unleſſe there bee withall ſome promiſe annexed, and ſuppoſed in his being come. The promiſe meerely of Chriſts comming could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, unleſſe alſo in and by Chriſt come in the fleſh, there bee ſome promiſe made to them, touching the removall of thoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of guilt which lay upon them. 3. The bleſſing principally propounded to them, for their reviving, healing, ſuccour, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41963:19"/> ſupport, it was not Chriſts ſending, nor his being ſent, but remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. wherefore unleſſe the Apoſtle argue imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, this may not be excluded, but muſt bee one principall thing intended. 4. It is that promiſe to which Baptiſme the ſeale is annexed, now the ſeale is ever to the Covenant, which is not barely to Chriſts being ſent in the fleſh, but to the benefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in promiſes by his comming. The third thing they ſay, it is to thoſe of the diſperſion, thoſe of the ten Tribes, as others have expreſſed it, and why not alſo of the Gentiles as well? ſince ſpoken indefinitely of all that were afarre of; which the Scripture expreſly applyeth to the Gentiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Suppoſe thoſe other Jewes were as the Gentiles, not a people actually in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, ſo much as externally, as being long divorced from God, and his Covenant, and Church-liberties, yet the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in the maine of their outlawry condition, were as one with them. Yea, but the converſion of the Gentiles was not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, till <hi>Act.</hi> 10. in that viſion. What? had not Chriſt before this Sermon of <hi>Peters</hi> declared his mind to all his Apoſtles touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſcipling, and In-churching of the Gentiles? onely they knew not whether it might be by joyning them firſt by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as proſelytes to the Jewes, rather then by gathering them into other diſtinct Churches. 4. It's affirmed, that <q rend="inline">this promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſending of Chriſt was to them, their children, and thoſe afarre off, as many as our God ſhould call, that they may bee turned from their iniquitie, and bee baptized for remiſſion of ſinnes, and yet alſo that the promiſe, what ever it bee ſuppoſed to bee, was to them all, with that limitation, that they repent, or that they be called.</q> What? is it to as many as the Lord ſhall call, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or cauſe to repent? and yet is it, that they may bee turned from their iniquitie? is it to perſons called, and yet alſo to uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led perſons? is it to them, that they may bee called, yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the promiſe is, are as many as are ſuppoſed to bee called? how can theſe two bee right? yea it's ſaid, it is to them all, upon condition that they be called, and yet alſo, that it is to them, that they may be called. Why, if it be to them, that by Chriſt they may bee called, then is that promiſe to perſons as yet uncalled, and their calling is an effect following their intereſt in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as a cauſe, and not preceding their intereſt in the promiſe as a condition. As touching this, whether the ſole condition of this being of the promiſe to them, &amp;c. we ſhall examine that anon, God willing.</p>

Nor will <hi>C.

Or had they no children but ſuch as were men growne? or if they had, did they intend that curſe of blood to bee on their growne children, and not as well on their babes? on their children indefinitely? To like purpoſe is <hi>A.

                     <p n="1">But 1. Is it the uſe of Scriptures to propound comforts to ſuch kind of perſons by allegories?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If it bee ſuppoſed, that the naturall children are excluded, and onely allegoricall children underſtood, there needed no ſuch circumlocution. But it might have been plainly thus, The promiſe is to you, and to your children, even to ſuch as are afarre off, as many as God ſhall call: whereas hee ſpeaketh diſtinctly of all three; it is to you, and to your children, and to ſuch as are afarre off, as many as God ſhall call.</p>

For <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. all kindreds of the earth are mentioned, as thoſe that ſhould bee bleſſed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. Yea, doe not ſuch as ſo ſpeak, affirme before, that this promiſe of ſending Chriſt, was to them, their children, and thoſe afarre off? which notion <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. applies to the Gentiles. They are the children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. and hee doth not ſay thus, and of the fathers, with whom the Covenant is made, as if it were meant in reſpect of bare naturall relation, but, and of the Covenant made with the fathers, to ſhew, that it's meant of Church, and federall intereſt in them, as Covenant fathers, and diſpenſers: yea, to ſhew, that the Covenant was as ſeed, by vertue whereof, they conſidered as federally and eccleſiaſtically priviledged, did ſpring. I had thought that theſe parallel phraſes, that [children of the Covenant] of grace, mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25. and [children of the promiſe] <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 28. was not meerely applyed to either Jewes or Galatians, becauſe Chriſt according to the promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. came into the world; that bleſſing might bee offered to them, through him the promiſed ſeed. But becauſe they had a viſible intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of bleſſing by him, and therefore both Jewes and Galatians were ſo ſtiled; ſure I am, <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe of the Jewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. To whom belongs the adoption and the promiſes, comprehending <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34. holdeth forth no bare offer thereof, but at leaſt an externall intereſt therein. And <hi>C. B.</hi> who maketh the promiſe to bee the offer of it to them, their children and thoſe afar off, as many as the Lord ſhall call, will not eaſily reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to others of his mind, denying that the Scripture hath to doe with children that way, in that they underſtand not. And how then is the offer of the promiſe at preſent [the promiſe is] to your children] unto thoſe children, many of which were but Infants? Beſides, thoſe afarre off from them, as were the Gentiles, how was the promiſe to them then in the offer thereof, when as yet it was not offered to them, untill afterwards, that the Jews came to reject the ſame, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46, 47. unleſſe in reſpect of ſome few ſprinklings and firſt fruits, which yet was after this alſo, Act. 8. 10. Or, if he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41963:21"/> doe ſtretch it to the future, with others, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that it is to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that limitation that they be called, namely effectually; ſurely he will not ſay, that the promiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> the meere offer thereof is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. Now, to come to that wherein <hi>A. R.</hi> and <hi>Hen. Den,</hi> and others doe center, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That it was no otherwiſe to the Jewes, then to thoſe afar off, and ſo, and no otherwiſe to their children, or (as <hi>A.

But why are all made equall herein? <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25, 26. even as it is expounded by our oppoſites, will give the Jewes the prioritie, the Text is expreſſe, and to you firſt, &amp;c. all are not then equall therein. The Gentiles come not in, but by occaſion of the Jewes caſting out, and then they conſidered as in Olive or Church-eſtate, partake of no other Church fatneſſe, for ſubſtance, then did their predeceſſors the Jewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. 15. 17. no other kingdome for the nature of it, and in the eſſentialls of the externall right, and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the royall Covenant to the Gentile ſucceſſor, then was to the Jewiſh predeceſſor, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11. 12. and 21. 43.

For hee expounds this Text, Act. 2. 38, 39. to bee the promiſe mentioned in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. of powring out the extraordinary gifts of the ſpirit upon them. Now doth <hi>A. R.</hi> ſuppoſe the ſame reaſon of pouring out ſuch gifts on the Gentiles to bee called to the worlds end, as was in thoſe firſt times of planting the Goſpell? or would hee have all beleevers now expect ſuch extraordinary gifts, as having according to his expoſition, this place and promiſe for it? I ſuppoſe not, why then doth hee make them all equall?

And for further diſcovery of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken expoſition, let it bee conſidered. 1 That the very confeſſed occaſion of this here ſpoken to theſe heart-pierced Jewes, was the guilt of hainous ſinnes, and of that curſed wiſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 25. They were not troubled for want of ſuch extraordinary gifts, and to tell them of ſuch gifts, was both impertinent and unſatisfactory, and it could miniſter but little comfort to ſin-ſick ſoules, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them ſuch gifts, which they might have, and yet die in their ſinnes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 23. 2 As the maine thing propounded, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>ſcil.</hi> of remiſſion of ſinnes, is not ſo much as named, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that in <hi>Joel</hi> ſet downe in this order, I will poure out my ſpirit upon you, and upon your children; or thus, you and your ſonnes and daughters (onely) ſhall propheſie. 3.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41963:23"/> which by his blood ſhould come, actually, as well as virtually, to ratifie the Covenant of grace, viſibly made with them, as they did in receiving the ſeale of Circumciſion, but that they owne the Lord Jeſus, who was crucified by, and among them, as he which a lone did thus: which amongſt other teſtimonies Baptiſme witne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, therefore more was now required of the adult-Jewes, then formerly; which yet was not required of their unripe Children: even as when wee are to receive members of other viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, into compleat fellowſhip of all Church priviledges, and ordinances with us: wee require ſome ſatisfaction of the growne perſons, to teſtifie their repentance of their former Church-ſinnes, and perſonall ſcandalls, therein committed, and their willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto the government, and worſhip and doctrine of Chriſt, as adminiſtred amongſt us; not becauſe wee queſtion the truth of their Church-eſtate elſewhere, but, becauſe thoſe Churches, albeit true, yet very corrupt, and themſelves then ſcandalous; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all being deſirous, not to bee with us barely, as tranſient mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by vertue of Communion of Churches, but being to be of us, as fixed members, wee reſt not in their former Church ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but require of ſuch, ſome new ingagements, in reference to us; and yet we require not this of their children, which are not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> nor capable of giving perſonall ſatisfaction, but admit them to the initiatory ſeale of baptiſme with: us ſo was it with them, <hi>Acts</hi> the ſecond, being to bee incorporated into a purer company, exhibiting the Ordinances of Chriſt in a more perfect evangelicall way. Nor muſt that needs follow, which <hi>A. K.</hi> ſaith, that becauſe it's ſaid, they were added to the Church, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not of the Church before, but after <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake thoſe words, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 39. the promiſe is to you, &amp;c. for this is as well ſpoken after that expreſſion that they were baptized, as after that mentioned, of their receiving the word gladly, and yet will our oppoſites conclude, that therefore they were not of the Church, nor in the Covenant before they were baptized, but came into that eſtate by baptiſme? if Baptiſme were the forme of the Church, or that which they ſo much urge wholly failed; that a perſon muſt bee firſt diſcipled and ſo in Covenant and Church-eſtate before he be baptized.</p>
                     <p>Nor is that cogent, which is urged againſt the Childrens right in the promiſe and unto Baptiſme, that they ſhould bee ſo priviledged, when they came to be effectually called, and to bee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41963:24"/> turned from their ſinnes, as if this were <hi>quoad homines,</hi> their onely rule of judging of perſons viſible intereſt in the Covenant of grace, or viſible right to the initiatory ſeale thereof: or at leaſt the onely way of having ſuch a viſible intereſt in the viſible Churches Court. For beſides that it was not ſo of old, in applying of circumciſion, as Gods appointed ſeale of the parties viſible Covenant eſtate and right: even with us alſo, it is not the rule in <hi>Foro Eccleſiae:</hi> for then none are by the Church to bee by rule admitted to baptiſme, but ſuch as are effectually called: and then, <hi>John</hi> which knew, that the moſt of them which hee baptized, would bee as chaffe in the floore, hee kept not rule, in baptizing of them. Or if calling bee taken for externall inviting, in the word preached, and offer of Chriſt, that I ſuppoſe will not be pleaded: for then every hearer ſhould be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with baptized, albeit an Indian or Black a more; but calling as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in reference to baptizing unto remiſſion of ſinnes, ſeemeth to bee rather calling into viſible Covenant, and Church-eſtate: unto which ſome, whoſe was the promiſe intentionally, yet were afar off from that eſtate actually at preſent, but when called to it, they were then to bee baptized. And yet further to evince, that the little ones of theſe Jewes, not then capable of actuall repenting, were not in defect of that repentance, excluded from the promiſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39.

How ſuch doctrine might well ſtumble, and trouble ſuch Parents, let any ſober and judicious mind judge; to bee ſure they have laid a load of guilt, and given a deadly wound unto their poore babes, by that curſe of theirs; now if they are as Pagan ſtrangers from the Covenant, then is there no hope, in reference to ordinary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed grounds and wayes of hope and life, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13.

The Apoſtles which as yet preached not, for the aboliſhing even of Moſaicall rites, would much leſſe at that time, ſo publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold forth, implicitely at leaſt, the excluſion of the Jewes babes, from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. And verily the Apoſtles which ſo long after, were ſo tender of the better and more pliable part of the Jewes, that they would have <hi>Paul</hi> to take off that aſperſion, as if hee ſhould as yet lay a neceſſitie upon the Jewes, not to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe their children, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 20. 22, 23, 24. would much leſſe give ſuch manifeſt and juſt offence to them, as to hold forth an excluſion of their babes, from right in that Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> it ſelfe, whereof Circumciſion was a viſible ſeale; as the places quoted in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. 13. and <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 8. declare.</p>

Theſe Jewes are eyed by the Apoſtles, as perſons to partake of priviledges of a Church of Chriſtians, as was baptiſme; and therefore what extent of federal right &amp; priviledge is granted by the Apoſtles to them, and theirs in that way, is equally belonging to Gentiles in a like way. 3. To ſuppoſe God by Apoſtolical ratification, to allow to children of Jewiſh parents comming on to Chriſt, &amp;c. a larger priviledge then to Gentile parents, as came on to Chriſt, &amp;c. is to make God a reſpecter of perſons. 4. The force of the words ſeeme to carry it, that the ſame promiſe which was to thoſe Jewes actually in Church and Covenant eſtate, was intentionally to thoſe afarre off which were ſtrangers actually from a like eſtate, whether thoſe of the ten tribes, or rather thoſe of the Gentiles, and ſhould be actually to them, when they came to bee called actually into the fellowſhip of that Covenant and Church eſtate. Now what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was that? Verily a promiſe, which carried with it a partiall reference unto their children: The promiſe is to you, and to your children: And the ſame is unto them afar off, whom God ſhall call, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in reference to their children alſo.</p>

Touching which, and ſo the whole doctrine of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall holineſſe propounded, let us make uſe of a few diſtinctions, and then ſet downe ſome few concluſions, and withall take off what is brought to the contrary. The Covenant of grace is conſidered either nakedly, or as inveſted with a viſible politicall Church-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, if not explicite, yet implicit. Wee are to conſider this place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. not ſo much in the former, as in the later ſenſe; God making of it with reference to the Church, which was to remaine in the poſteritie of <hi>Iſaac, verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. albeit at preſent it bee to bee contained in <hi>Abrahams</hi> owne family, whence alſo hee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth an initiatory ſeale, and way of reſtipulation, to which they ſubmitting together, as one ſelected body, collectively, and as members thereof, diſtributively, they did implicitly make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and promiſe to God, and bind themſelves in a nearer reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious tie one unto another.

                     <p>Againe, that Covenant of grace is conſidered either in it ſelfe, or in its adminiſtration; to which purpoſe circumciſion is called the Covenant, partly, becauſe it was the ſigne and ſeale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11, 12, 13. Partly too, becauſe it was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace in the adminiſtration of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 11. and <hi>Eſay</hi> 24. 5. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 10. hath reference to the Covenant of grace both as inveſted with Church-covenant, and in reſpect of Church-adminiſtration thereof.</p>
                     <p>Concerning perſons being in covenant, ſome are ſaid to bee in the covenant intentionally, ſo children of the Church, which are yet unborne, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 15. ſo thoſe afarre off, the promiſe was to them at that time, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. ſo the Jewes alſo which yet were to come in, were in <hi>Pauls</hi> time holy Federally, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15, 16. or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſo were the Jewes holy which were not cut off in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, <hi>Ibid.</hi> ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 14. we attend rather to the later then the former in this diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>Perſons actually in covenant, are either internally and ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in covenant, as are all true beleevers, and their children which belong to Gods election: and as were many of thoſe included in that phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. and as were <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which were not onely children of the promiſe, intentionally, before they were borne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 9, 10, 11. but actually, as ſoone as borne; God revealing his mind of covenant-grace in ſuch ſort, as never rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame, after they were actually borne, hence that <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23. 28. compared, albeit many of the <hi>Galatians</hi> were but ſuch, in point of viſibilitie, as appeareth. Or they are ſuch as are onely externally in the covenant, thus even <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was, for circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was even to him alſo Gods covenant or viſible ſeale thereof. This diſtinction is the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. hee ſpeakes of ſome to whom the promiſes belonged, <hi>ſcil.</hi> onely externally, and of others to whom they belonged, in reſpect of the ſaving efficacy thereof, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>Such as are externally in covenant are either ſuch as are ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne perſonall right meerely, as many proſelytes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 44, 45. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11. even thoſe <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> ſo were the ſoules in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe which hee gained to his religion, according to <hi>Ainſworth, Gen.</hi> 12. 5. ſuch as hee had commanded to feare God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 19. as appeares by their free ſubmiſſion to that ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous painefull ordinance to fleſh and blood, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 17. 27. Or ſuch as withall are externally in Covenant, ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as inveſted with Church-covenant, in their parents right: as the Jewes and Proſelytes Children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11. God accepting the actuall owning of his Covenant by the grown part, and parents inſtead of the children alſo. So of all collectively is that ſpoken, not onely that God that day avouched them to bee his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 18. both parents and children, as alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 16. and 29. but thou haſt avouched the Lord to bee thy God, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. thou collective <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet it was acted but by the growne part in their own, &amp; in their childrens ſtead. <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed is either taken for the head and principall as was Chriſt, and ſo rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and 22. 18. or for the head and body together even Chriſt myſticall, ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 15. Thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe the gates of thine enemies, and ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. Jew and Gentile but one ſeed with Chriſt the head of the Church. Again, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed is either taken collectively, or diſtributively; collectively, either his ſeed by propagation, or proportion. In the former ſenſe the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41963:26"/> Jewes in their generations, were the ſeed mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. that is, parents and children, for they are ſeed in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſeed by proportion, were the Proſelytes of old in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and viſible inchurched beleevers in their generations, <hi>ſcil.</hi> parents and children together. And both againe are conſidered ſpecifically, or individually: ſpecifically, ſo ſome of that ſort of parents and growne perſons and ſome of that ſort of children are as well internally and ſavingly in the covenant as externally: albeit many individuall perſons of both ſorts are onely externally; thus, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 14. with [him] that is here and with [him] that is not here: him, not them, as noting a collection; yea a certaine ſpecies, or ſort of perſons growne or babes, and of babes borne or unborne: according to a different reſpect of Gods making his covenant with them. So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. to thy ſeed indefinitely, God abſolutely covenanting thus, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. with them in their ſpecies and ſorts: conditionally in reſpect of the individuall perſons of each ſort.

All this is included as by vertue of Gods covenant offered to ſuch as hee is a God to, yea and as that which according to men, and as men are in charitie to judge, is with all the viſible right of ſuch. Albeit, the former two ſenſes ſuffice, to the viſible adminiſtration of the covenant, as their right; in that God doth hold forth that hee is a God to ſuch in covenant, to whom hee giveth his ordinances, and with whom hee vouchſafeth his preſence therein as their externall covenant right. 3.

As if theſe two expreſſions were as wide as a covenant, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion it ſelfe was, and a ſigne of another covenant; when every one that hath read catecheticall doctrine will ſay, that when in one verſe it's ſaid of circumciſion in their fleſh, that it was his Covenant in their fleſh: it is a uſuall Metonymy in ſpeaking of Sacraments to call the outward ſacramentall ſigne and ſeale, by the name of the thing ſignified and ſealed. As the cup is called the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Chriſts blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. that is, the viſible ſigne or ſeale of it. The bread is called Chriſts body, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. So in menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning that extraordinary ſacrament, the rock is called Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and here in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. Circumciſion is called a token or ſacramentall ſigne of the covenant, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. The ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, where the Scripture ſpeaketh plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and explicitely. Yet here <hi>A. R.</hi> will have Chriſt himſelfe to hold forth other doctrine then is uſuall in ſpeaking of Sacraments. Fourthly, that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and thoſe Jewes another Covenant diſtinct from that everlaſting covenant, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that covenant of circumciſion. And yet alſo made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſpirituall ſeed that other everlaſting covenant, of which the circumciſion of Jewes was a ſigne; as if God at one and the ſame time made with one and the ſame perſon <hi>Abraham</hi> two diſtinct co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, one which was not the everlaſting covenant or covenant
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41963:29"/> of grace, namely the covenant of circumciſion, as 'tis called; and the other which was that everlaſting covenant it ſelfe: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that circumciſion was given by God who ſaid it ſhall bee a ſigne to them, to bee a ſigne of a covenant made, not between God and them that by his appointment were thus circumciſed, but of a covenant made betwixt God and others: when the letter of the Text is thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. It ſhall bee a token of the covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween mee and you. What covenant was that? was it that <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. where it's ſaid, This is my covenant which you ſhall keep between me and you and thy ſeed after thee? nay, that was a dutie and condition of the covenant rather, which they were to keepe or obſerve, as it followes: this is my covenant, every manchild a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you ſhall bee circumciſed, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. yee ſhall circumciſe the foreskin of your fleſh: So then circumciſion is but a branch of the covenant or a condition of the covenant on their part, which in the ſacramentall nature of it is a ſigne, not of that mentioned which was their dutie in being circumciſed, and ſo circumciſing their fleſh, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. ſhould bee a ſigne of being circumciſed, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. which were abſurd; But rather it is a ſigne of the covenant of God, even that covenant mentioned <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>ſcil.</hi> of Gods becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a God to them: which is eſſentially the very everlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace. And whereas <hi>A. R.</hi> his <hi>Pſeudo-Chriſtus</hi> ſaith, that circumciſion in their fleſh was to bee an everlaſting covenant in their fleſh, and yet to bee but a ſigne of that everlaſting Covenant, &amp;c. grounding upon that <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. my covenant in your fleſh ſhall bee for an everlaſting covenant: As if it ſhould meane, that that eternall covenant was not made with them that had that ſigne of the covenant at the preſent, but yet it was to bee made with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when yet the ſame phraſe uſed in mentioning the ſigne is uſed in expreſſing the forme of the covenant it ſelfe, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. I will eſtabliſh my covenant between mee and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>in faedus ſeculi,</hi> unto or for a covenant of perpetuitie, to bee a God to thee and to thy ſeed after thee. Here the phraſe for an everlaſting covenant evidently noteth, not any future covenant, which is not here held forth, but the qualification rather of that covenant, which God ſaith hee will eſtabliſh at preſent with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; for having mentioned the covenants, hee expreſſeth the qualifications of the covenant it ſelfe, that it is of no temporary but of an everlaſting nature. And then ſetteth downe the matter of his Covenant thus
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41963:29"/> made with him and his ſeed, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that hee will bee a God to them, and that <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. is but a Sacramentall phraſing of the ſame thing.</p>

Not as if this were all which God required of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his ſeed, but becauſe this was the firſt initiating condition, and that which did as an initiatory ſacramentall ſigne, in a more peculiar way, incorporate him and them into one inſtituted Church-body at preſent, which ſhould more fully bee carried on for after time in <hi>Iſaacs</hi> time, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. 21. and 21. 12.

Hence alſo if others deſired to partake of that Church ordinance of the paſſeover, albeit they might bee otherwiſe godly, yet they might not bee admitted to the ſame, unleſſe by circumciſion ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into their Church body, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 44. 48.

But verily in requiring circumciſion many other duties lay upon them virtually. As firſt, the knowledge of their owne undone eſtate by nature: as being perſons whoſe blood not of one member of their body alone, but even of their whole man, the life of body and ſoule might in juſtice bee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, and this not ſo much in regard of actuall ſins of their owne, as in regard alſo of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne derived to them by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation; if they had no more guilt then that they deſerved to die. Secondly alſo, knowledge of their extreame need of Chriſt, whoſe blood as the blood of the principall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was to bee ſhed in fulneſſe of time, and by virtue whereof that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was at preſent ratified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. 17.

Thoſe of the Jewiſh Church had faith required of them to juſtification, as well as the baptized Gentiles; all duties and branches and acts of repentance and mortification, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in required alſo, of perſons admitted to the ſeale of circumciſion; hence ſuch exhortations thereon grounded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 16.

So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. hee made a Covenant with that Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, many whereof proved very baſe, as that Chapter ſheweth. Now this was a covenant of grace, albeit inveſted with Church-covenant, as appeares in that <hi>verſ.</hi> 60. that God for that his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſake conſidered as his, will deale ſo gratiouſly with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their provocations, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 62, 63.

There is an externall being in the covenant of grace, as there is an externall being in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. and partaking of Chriſt, hence that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 14. An externall belonging to Chriſt: hence thoſe Jewiſh refuſers to beleeve in Chriſt, yet called his owne, <hi>John</hi> 1. 11. As there is an externall being called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 14. an externall being ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. an externall being purged from ſinne, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall being purchaſed by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. an externall Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. And therefore both are joyned, being Saints, and making a Covenant with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. and ſuch as had Gods
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41963:30"/> covenant made with them to glory of, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. yet what perſons many of them were that Pſalme doth declare. There are thoſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches which are as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, children of the promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. children of the Goſpel Church, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. and 26. this muſt bee verified in all the members of the Galatian Churches, unto whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote that Epiſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2. for hee ſpake this of them all; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is the mother of us [all] <hi>verſe</hi> 26, 27, 28. compared: They then were all ſuch either effectually and ſavingly: And then there were ſome particular viſible Churches in which were no hypocrites. Contrary to the very ſcope of the parable of the Tares, and Net, and Virgins, and Wedding, and varietie of veſſels in the Church viſible as an houſe of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. Yea then there ſhould bee a poſſibilitie that ſuch as are ſavingly intereſſed in the covenant of grace ſhould end in the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. ſuffer many things in vaine, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. have Apoſtolicall labour beſtowed on them in vaine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 11. fall from grace, and have no profit to ſalvation by Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. 4. for if there were not a poſſibilitie of ſome ſuch members and caſes to bee found in the Galatian Churches; why doth the Apoſtle ſpeake ſuch things as there are mentioned? but there is no poſſibilitie of fatall ſeducing the elect one, ſavingly intereſted in the covenant and Church. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16. 19, 20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. So then it muſt needs follow that according to God, ſome were ſuch indeed, but externally and according to men all were children of the promiſe. In which ſenſe the promiſe of grace and glory may bee to one as ones legacy, or portion externally, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to men, of the ſaving good whereof it is poſſible one may fall ſhort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. 4. When Antipaedobaptiſts admit any to the ſeales of Church and covenant fellowſhip, is it not poſſible that ſome falſe brethren may creepe in unawares, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. ſome wolves enter in, and of their owne ſelves ſome turne ſeducers? <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 29, 30. can it be otherwiſe but that in viſible Churches with us or them, there will bee ſome unapproved ones to God? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18, 19. yet you admit them to the fellowſhip of covenant, but without ground, unleſſe to them they are in covenant. Will you ordinarily put ſeales to blankes? and the ſeale muſt follow the covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 9, 10, 11. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. You will ſurely ſay, they appeared to us, to bee in the covenant of grace; wee judged them to bee in it: elſe wee had not admitted them. So then according to your ſelves, perſons may bee externally and <hi>quoad homines</hi> in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41963:31"/> the Covenant of grace, which are not ſavingly ſo; I plead for no more; wee are then thus farre agreed; I yeeld no more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>Arminius,</hi> nor undermine perſeverance in grace, nor the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemicall doctrine of our choyſe Divines more then you doe, nor then <hi>Ameſius, Chamier, Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and then your owne <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as you count him, doth; who in his booke <hi>De Anima,</hi> Chap. 21, 22. urgeth that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. for a peculiar cleanneſſe of beleevers children by priviledge of ſeed, as the reſt which I have named: to whom <hi>Pareus, Peter Martyr, Bucer, Melancton, Mr. Philpot,</hi> beſides many others might bee added, who pleading for Infants baptiſme, urge it from their intereſt in the Covenant. As many of the ancients, <hi>Cyprian, Gregory, Nazianzen, Jerome, Auſtine</hi> and others which plead for Paedobaptiſme from the argument of circumciſion, muſt need implicitly, if not expreſly, maintaine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Covenant eſtate, to which the baptiſme of the one as the circumciſion of the other was <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> a ſacramentall ſigne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. And yet they held not, that all ſuch were infallibly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore muſt maintaine with mee, an externall inbeing of ſome in covenant which poſſibly may never be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>But leaving humane authorities to returne to Scripture proofe of this third concluſion; let our oppoſites conſider of Gods breaking that gratious Covenant which hee had made with his people of old, which was as his ſtaffe of beautie, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11: 10, whether it can be verified of a legall covenant of workes and not rather of his covenant of grace in reſpect at leaſt of the externall adminiſtration thereof amongſt them, as <hi>verſe</hi> 9. and their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall right in that his covenant. And whence elſe is there any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of ſome intereſted in that ſame covenant of God wherein the upright are faithfull, ſtable, and perminent, but others are falſe, treacherous, and apoſtatiſing? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 30, 31, 32, 33. If they were never in this holy covenant, how came they to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, to deale falſely in it? or was this Covenant wherein they together with thoſe true beleevers were intereſted in communion, other then the covenant of grace? If it were not that from <hi>Sion,</hi> was it that from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which are the Apoſtles <hi>membra di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia</hi> of the covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. If ſo, then beleevers, which as beleevers muſt neceſſarily be in the free covenant of life and grace, yet alſo at the ſame time are under a contrary covenant of bondage and death and curſe; if this covenant in which they were with true beleevers were a covenant of grace, as is evident, then were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41963:31"/> hypocrites externally in it, for internally and efficaciouſly they were not; and whence elſe were they charged with breaking the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant, <hi>cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And what need that preoccupation of the Apoſtle, when ſpeaking before of the promiſe indefinitely, as belonging even to thoſe refuſe Jews, he ſaith: not that the word of God tooke none effect, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in the perſons to whom it belonged: As if his meaning were thus, to prevent all objection, I yeeld that many to whom the word of Gods gratious covenant did externally belong, never got any ſaving good by it, as appeareth by their ſad caſe at preſent, <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3. but yet this will not follow, that Gods covenant had none effect at all, namely in others which were ſavingly intereſted therein. And the reaſon hee giveth is added, for they are not all <hi>Iſrael</hi> which are of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> as if hee would ſay, they are indeed <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> or of called, covenant, in-churched <hi>Iſrael, verſe</hi> 4. and 6. compared, but they are not all elected <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo then, that the word of covenant taketh not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly in ſuch like perſons, it is neither in that they were not in that covenant externally; for the promiſe belonged to them, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. nor that the word of Gods covenant is not <hi>per ſe</hi> efficacious; ſince it doth take effect in as many as are the choyſe ſeed, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended in that Covenant; but here rather is the ſecret ground of it: They are not, nor never were elected of God, and ſuch as in his ſecret counſell hee intended and ordained to extend eternall mercy to: for had they been of that number they could never (according to the objection included) have ſo fallen as to reject and caſt off ſo irrecoverably the revealed grace and mercy of Gods covenant as ratified in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 45, 46, 47, 48. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. and 9. 31, 32, 33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8. compared: This here ſaid may ſerve for anſwer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> his diſtinction of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace and an outward Covenant, &amp;c. they are not two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct covenants, but the covenant of grace made with the elect in reſpect of their ſaving intereſt in that, I will bee a God to them;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41963:32"/> the ſame is made with others, in reſpect both of viſible intereſt, and the viſible adminiſtration of it; nor is <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. a proofe of an outward covenant, diſtinct from the covenant of grace, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. but it is the covenant or conditionall part and dutie of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on their parts. As God had before told <hi>Abraham</hi> what was his part of the covenant, both more perſonally reſpecting <hi>Abraham, verſe</hi> 4, 5, 6. As for me, or my part: behold my Covenant is with thee, and more parentally and radically in reſpect to him conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his ſeed, <hi>verſe</hi> 7, 8.

If <hi>Abraham</hi> demand, What is that his and his ſeeds part? It is anſwered <hi>verſe</hi> 10. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame principle may ſundry objections of <hi>I. S.</hi> againſt the truth in queſtion bee anſwered; as, that there is but one way of entring into covenant, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by a true and lively faith. The contrary whereof here appeares in that perſons may bee ſaid to bee in covenant with God in reſpect of externall right which never came to beleeve actually nor ſavingly. Of like nature is that; the promiſe being yea and amen in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. ſuch as have not true faith in him, as Infants &amp;c. have not, they cannot bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the covenant, to which purpoſe alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. 27. 29. is brought; now taking that of ſaving faith, wee ſee others may bee called the children of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20, 21. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. yea children of the promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 28. then ſuch as doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to ſaving faith, as before was cleared. Of the like nature is that, that wee by our doctrine doe ſet up another way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then by regeneration; which is a meere <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> ſince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſons may bee in covenant with God, on whom the word never taketh effect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. and 6. compared, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our doctrine; we diſclaime that concluſion, that all that are externally in covenant attaine ſalvation; nor doth that ſequell of univerſall redemption follow from our doctrine of Federall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſince wee maintaine no other but that whatever ſuch are <hi>quoad homines</hi> counted redeemed of the Lord, and ſometimes ſo ſtiled, as that viſible Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is ſaid to bee purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28, &amp;c. yet in that and other viſible Churches many prove otherwiſe, even rent-members, <hi>verſe</hi> 29, 30. ſo 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. If theſe had not been externally in Covenant, they had not been in the Churches. And albeit they were ſo, yet the effect proved they were not internally of the number of redeemed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41963:32"/> ones. Hitherto that <hi>Dilemma</hi> being reduced may receive anſwer. That according to our doctrine beleevers children being in the covenant of grace: that covenant is made with them, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally or abſolutely; if conditionally, then either on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, or workes. Not of workes, none will affirme that, then of faith: and that is nugatory to ſay this Covenant is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſeed, if beleevers; to which branch wee anſwer, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is theirs externally, and <hi>quoad homines:</hi> conſidered as inveſted with Church-covenant, and in reference to Covenant Ordinances, whereof they are capable, as of old they were of Circumciſion, and are now of baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>Thus it's theirs at preſent, in reſpect of the viſible faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the parent or parents in the Covenant, and for the future, it's theirs in the further grace of the Covenant, upon condition of their beleeving if they live to yeeres of diſcretion: If abſolutely, then God either keepes it, and ſo all the ſeed of beleevers ſhould bee ſaved, which is falſe, or hee doth not keepe what hee abſolutely covenanted, which to affirme were blaſphemy. Wee anſwer, God may bee ſaid abſolutely to covenant with beleevers ſeed, collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpecifically conſidered; and yet all the Individuall children not ſaved. It is abſolutely made, and made good, that that ſort of perſons ſhall bee and are ſaved by vertue of Gods Covenant, for ſome of them are infallibly ſaved: The Covenant is to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite collective ſeed or children, in reſpect of the internall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intereſt: elſe none of them dying Infants ſhould bee ſaved. Suppoſing they are the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, a part of the elect ſeed, yet the meanes of ſaving effect in and upon them is the word of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. It's thorough the effectuall word and ingaged truth of God that that part of the Church are ſavingly purged, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26. The Covenant is to the individuall ſeede, all and each of them in reſpect of externall intereſt, and yet many of them not ſaved, nor yet is Gods faithfulneſſe impeached or impaired, nor need the faith of beleevers bee ſhaken, if this or that child ſhould prove, live and die wicked, the force of the Covenant is not to bee meaſured by the fatall miſcarrying of many of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Church ſeed. To bee ſure it taketh in ſome of his Church-ſeed, as the Apoſtle reaſoneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. 6. compared, Whether our doctrine herein or the adverſaries which deny any intereſt at all to any beleevers Infants in the Covenant, bee more uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, let the world judge. And therefore to affirme with <hi>Paul,</hi> if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41963:33"/> taken in the ſtrict of elect ones, and of ſincere beleevers, that they onely are <hi>Abrahams</hi> choyce ſeed, yet it's no other then Goſpell to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme as much as wee have done of others: ye they alſo are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Church ſeed.</p>

                        <label>4.</label> A Fourth Concluſion is, that the Church in diſpenſing an enjoyned Initiatory ſeale of the Covenant of grace, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth unto viſibilitie of intereſt in the Covenant to guide her in the application thereof. Nor is it the ſaving intereſt of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in view which is her rule by which ſhee is therein to proceed. The matter to bee diſpenced is not an Initiatory ſeale of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant before it bee commanded, as before Circumciſion or bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme bee commanded: but ſuppoſing that <hi>de facto</hi> they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, the rule of judging of the <hi>jus</hi> of perſons propounded to the Church, with deſire of her admiſſion by her officers, to the fellowſhip of the initiatory ſeale of the Covenant; it is not the internall and ſaving ſtate of the partie, or parties, but the viſibility of covenant right and eſtate; ſaving right, conſiſting in Gods electing act which is a very ſecret: in ſaving intereſt in Chriſt and his death: in ſaving influences and operations of his ſpirit and the like, all which incurre not to outward diſcerning, nor can be infallibly known by man being things <hi>per ſe</hi> inviſible to others, <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did and might lawfully baptize thoſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, albeit in the generall hee knew that many, yea moſt of them would prove falſe and frothy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. It ſufficeth that albeit hee were perſwaded in the generall, that many were unworthy members of that floore, and Church of Chriſt amongſt them all; yet they having appearances of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate, and hee not being able to ſay in the particular perſons preſented to baptiſme, which of them notwithſtanding would prove chaffie and vile, hee baptized them. Albeit wee may think in the generall that to bee ſure in all viſible Churches there will bee ſome veſſells of diſhonour ſometimes, and yet Miniſters which are the Churches, as well as Chriſts ſervants, they are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to refuſe, to diſpenſe Church-Ordinances; ſince they are in the face of the Church, ſuch utenſils, as the Lord may have and hath need of. Hence the Apoſtles which as extraordinary perſons, knew the guile of perſons ſecret from the Church, witneſſe that act againſt <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Act.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. to 11. Yet in adminiſtring the Church-ſeale of Baptiſme they refuſed not <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41963:33"/> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> no nor <hi>Simon Magus, Act.</hi> 8. nor thouſands of others of the Jewes, amongſt whom, how many proved falſe, let <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. and 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. compared, 21. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. 28. 30, 31. 36. and 22. 20. 22. and 23. 12, 13. witneſſe. Nor could the Apoſtles imagine otherwiſe in the generall, but many of them would prove ſuch. Yea Chriſt himſelfe, who by his divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, knew <hi>Judas</hi> to bee a devill, <hi>John</hi> 6. 70, 71. and 13. 18. yet hee miniſtred to him that Supper; whether the Paſcall Lambe or the Lords Supper, <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. 2. 26. and 21. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19, 20, 21. I determine not; one of them it appeares it was; <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and others thinke <hi>Judas</hi> was admitted to the Lords Supper, and that he did partake of the bread of the Lord, albeit, not of the Lord that ſpirituall bread: ſo thinkes Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> from that connexion, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 19, 20, 21. but if admitted by Chriſt to the Paſſeover which Chriſt adminiſtred to him formerly, and at that time, it ſufficeth to our purpoſe. Chriſt miniſtring as man, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with <hi>Judas</hi> in his miniſtration of the Sacrament as man, and as <hi>Judas</hi> was according to man, and to the reſt of that family to which hee then in ſpeciall ſort miniſtred. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> God diſcovered by a divine revelation to <hi>Abraham, Eſau</hi> to <hi>Rebeckah,</hi> not to bee Gods elect ſeed of the Covenant; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Prieſts at that time to the Church in their families, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe them; extraordinary caſes brake not ordinary rules. If <hi>Peter</hi> kill bodily any perſons, or <hi>Phinehas</hi> or <hi>Elias;</hi> It's not a warrant for Miniſters to bee executioners, or orderers of civill ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: It's the Magiſtrate is to do that by ordinary rule. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. If <hi>Ananias</hi> a private Diſciple by extraordinary call in a viſion, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <hi>Paul,</hi> yet it's no croſſe to that ordinary rule of miniſtring bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme onely by preaching miniſters, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. So here in extraordinary caſes perſons to bee admitted to the ſeales of the old or new Teſtament, may bee diſcovered to bee falſe hearted as was <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau</hi> and <hi>Judas:</hi> yet that hinders not, but being <hi>in facie Eccleſiae</hi> viſibly intereſted in the Covenant, the ſeales are to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto them. The Church in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaacs</hi> houſe had not that revealed to them touching <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the family of Chriſt knew that of <hi>Judas:</hi> therefore as to them they had viſible right to thoſe ſeales, ſo were they adminiſtred to them. A Miniſter may ſee much good or evill in perſons which are to partake of the ſeales: yet if this bee not as well viſible to the Church, as to himſelfe, hee cannot of himſelfe admit or reject
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41963:34"/> them regularly; hee is not the Church, but acteth in admiſſion &amp; rejections to or from the fellowſhip of Church-Ordinances ſuch as the ſeales are, by and with their conſent. A perſon Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally holy is admittable, and hee may not refuſe them upon his owne private ſurmiſes. It were to breed confuſions in Churches, and lay foundations of enthuſiaſmes. The ordinary Elders of that viſible Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> muſt feede the Church in the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word or ſeales occaſionally. Albeit, many admitted to that fellowſhip, many among themſelves will prove Apoſtates, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28, 29, 30. If particular perſons ſaving intereſt in Gods promiſe and Covenant of grace were the rule, it were either to neceſſitate miniſters to come under guilt of ſinne or Anomie, breach of rule or for avoiding of that, which they muſt needs doe with ſuch breach of rule, never to adminiſter any Church-ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſince they ſometimes ſhall breake that rule in adminiſtring the ſame to hypocrites, and albeit they doe ſometimes adminiſter them to elect ones, yet not being able to know that ſecret infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they obſerve not that rule in faith, but doubtingly, and ſo can have little comfort of any ſuch of their adminiſtrations.</p>
                     <p>If this therfore bee not the rule of Church adminiſtration of the Initiatory injoyned ſeale of the Covenant; then the other of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of intereſt is that which wee muſt goe by therein. Which may ſuffice for anſwer to what <hi>A. R.</hi> ſuggeſted to the contrary. And I ſay, viſibility of the parties intereſt in the Covenant, I ſay not meere viſibilitie of faith or repentance. The Initiatory ſeale is not primarily and properly the ſeale of mans faith, or repentance or obedience, but of Gods Covenant rather; the ſeale is to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, even <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion was not primarily a ſeale to his faith of righteouſneſſe; but to the righteouſneſſe of faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and offered in the covenant; yea to the Covenant it ſelfe or promiſe, which hee had beleeved unto righteouſneſſe; hence the covenant of grace is called the righteouſneſſe of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. The righteouſneſſe of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. and it's called the word of faith: hence albeit <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt walke before God, who is now about to enlarge the Covenant to his, as well as to make it to him, in a Church reference, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. &amp;c. yet the Initiatory ſeale in his as well as in their fleſh is Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. or a Sacramentall ſigne firſtly and expreſly of Gods Covenant, <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. and 7. compared; albeit, it implicitly oblige him and them to other duties formerly mentioned.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41963:34"/> Hence <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. the ſeale of baptiſme is put to the promiſe, as the choyſe matter and foundation in view, and as that was a ground of repentance it ſelfe. Repent and bee baptized, for the promiſe is to you: Not, for you have repented, as if that were the thing to bee firſtly ſealed by baptiſme, but the promiſe rather: and when wee ſpeake of viſibilitie of Covenant right, as ſuch a rule to goe by, wee exclude not the loweſt and leaſt degree of viſibilitie, ſince degrees doe not vary the ſpecies of any thing; if we propound a higher degree where ſhall wee ſtay and pitch? Why not a higher degree as well as that? wee muſt looke to it, that not the leaſt of Gods Covenant little ones bee left out unfolded in the Church viſible. Wee were better ſeeme to bee remiſſe in reſpect of Church care of 99. which are but ſeemingly juſt ones, then neglect any, and leave out any which poſſibly is ſavingly as well as ſeemingly of the flock of the covenant Church; the leaſt of Gods viſible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or Church muſt have their portion as of the family; if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters bee faithful in their office; the leaſt viſible meaſure of grace muſt occaſion our judgement of charitie to judge them gratious, ſo the leaſt degree of viſibilitie of covenant right may challenge the like charitie; not in word and in tongue but in deed and act of expreſſion, Wee put a difference betwixt thoſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and Infants in degrees of viſibilitie of this right, but in the nature of the viſibilitie wee ſay they are all one, all are viſibly in covenant, albeit that viſibilitie in point of degree bee not in all equall. God putteth a difference in point of degree of faith in juſtifyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but in his act of juſtifying of perſons hee puts no difference, the leaſt ſparke in Flax is enough that way: For if it were more it would flame as well as make a ſmoake, and yet if but ſo much it's not ſleighted by the Lord. I might apply the ſame in point of degrees of viſibilitie of Covenant right, in reference to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches act of approbation; It's a higher degree indeed of viſibility of intereſt in the Covenant to make perſonall profeſſion and confeſſion of faith in the Covenant, as it is in <hi>Adultis,</hi> then to have onely the viſible teſtimony of God in his word of Covenant expreſſing his mind of grace, touching the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to bee a God to them.

And this is to the Church a degree of their childrens viſibilitie of covenant right and Church right; albeit, not ſo high as the former, and not varying the ſpecies of viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it ſufficeth, not to vary the ſpecies of Church admiſſion to fellowſhip of the initiatory Church-ſeale. Judgement of charitie reacheth further then to judge of perſons eſtates by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall words or workes: Charitie beleeveth all things in way of teſtimony if they give any teſtimony; as that of God who teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more abſolutely for that ſpecies of beleevers children, that they are ſuch as hee doth covenant to bee a God to them. And the parents teſtifie alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Promiſes were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed Chriſt. Nay Chriſt perſonally conſidered is rather <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, not to, but in which the promiſes are confirmed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. with 16. But rather of Chriſt with his body the Church, whether of Gentiles or Jewes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. which though many perſonally yet make but one ſeed, and not many ſeeds, being all one in Chriſt the head of the Church, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. 28. compared, like as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. the ſeed of <hi>Eve,</hi> is Chriſt with his members in and with him, So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. the name of Chriſt is not aſcribed to the head the Lord Jeſus without his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Church: or to the Church of Jewes and Gentiles without him the head, but collectively conſidered. <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> whether this in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. be ſpoken of the viſible or inviſible Church. I anſwer, to me it ſeemes that the places admit of the conſideration of the Church as viſible. Firſt, in that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of all the Galatian Church-members as well as others, as one in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. Now were all thoſe members elected, will any ſay? I ſuppoſe not, yet all are one in Chriſt their head. Secondly, in that hee ſpeakes of them all as Sacramentally one with Chriſt in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28. compared, ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. Now albeit, the ſpirit bee the cauſe of the internall and ſaving union with Chriſt, in all which are united: As Eccleſiaſtically all the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> members were judged to bee; yet indeed and in truth there were many of them not approved to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18, 19. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. But in both places the Apoſtle conſidering them as a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Caecus:</hi> intimateth the conſideration thereof as a viſible, and not as an inviſible Church: Baptiſme being the ſeale committed to the viſible Church by her officers to bee diſpenſed, and not to the inviſible Church which hath no Officers in it, as ſuch. And bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme being by the Church adminiſtred to perſons as viſible, and not as inviſible members of the Church. Thirdly, in that Chriſt hath head-like influences into the officers and members, many whereof are not ſavingly joyned to him. Fourthly, in that it is the Church wherein hee hath ſet diverſitie of Church-officers, which are not ſet in the inviſible, but viſible Church: that Church being not inviſible but viſible where Church-officers are ſet and choſen, and act. From this conſideration it followeth, that albeit a mans owne perſonall faith uniteth him to Chriſt, in reſpect of ſaving and inviſible union, yet the profeſſion and confeſſion of faith before and in a viſible Church, in reference to viſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion therewith, this doth unite a perſon to Chriſt as head of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41963:36"/> the viſible Church; whether the party bee ſincere or no. Hence alſo a Parent, making profeſſion of faith in the covenant of grace, as inveſted with Church-covenant in reference to his children it doth unite them alſo to Chriſt, as head of the viſible Church ſo farre, as to give right to ſolemne imitation of them, into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Church in circumciſion as of old, or baptiſme as now.

Albeit, the juſt onely live an effectuall life of grace, and attaine the vertue of the ſeale by their owne faith, yet that hindreth not, but a child may attaine, as it were a Church-life, and pertake of the viſible intereſt and uſe of that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Church-ſeale, by his parents covenant and Church faith, or that faith which is ſuch to the Church. Nor yet doe wee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by eſtabliſh (as ſome ſay) a meriting faith, no more then we make viſibilitie of perſonall faith, to merit perſonall right to baptiſme, &amp;c. But rather the parents profeſſing to apply the covenant as made to him and his, there doth reſult a parentall as well as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall right. Such weight there is in the covenant applyed, as by vertue of the covenant of grace inveſted with Church-covenant thus profeſſedly applyed, there doth ariſe ſuch a union, as of the parent, ſo of the child (<hi>quoad homines</hi>) unto Chriſt, as head of the viſible Church. And looke as the covenant laid hold upon, by the lively faith of gracious parents, as made with reſpect to their children hath mighty force to effect very gratious things in the elect ſeed, yea albeit dying young, as ſundry of thoſe elect ones of <hi>Abrahams</hi> race did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. yea ſo as to make their outward wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings to become effectuall in Chriſt to an inward clenſing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26. yea ſo as to bring in and bring home many of ſuch cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant children.

So is there ſuch validitie in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant inveſted with Church-covenant, albeit but unworthily oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times held forth by the parents, which doth beget upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren an externall filiall relation unto God, and to his ſpouſe the viſible Church; whence that reſpect of children of God and his Church, by vertue of that Eſpouſall covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. Even in the children of Idolatrous members, <hi>verſe</hi> 20, 21. 23. Great is the force of this way of the covenant ſo clothed.

This conſideration with the former mentioned in that firſt concluſion, may alſo ſatisfie <hi>M. B.</hi> that our doctrine touching Infants covenant and Church-right to baptiſme doth not neceſſarily produce, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that abſurdity of a ſtate of grace and remiſſion of ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, or of birth grace (as <hi>J. I.</hi> hath it) conveyed from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to child: underſtanding it of grace abſolute and grace in them and not of grace upon them, or relative grace. And if of grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, yet if underſtanding what hee ſaith as meant of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſaving adoption, and not of externall adoption and covenant adminiſtration, the former they convey not, as neither doth a free Deniſon his perſonall gifts of wiſedome, &amp;c. the later hee may; not as a man barely, but with this reduplication, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a parent in covenant and Church and ſpirituall citie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; for ſo by vertue of the covenant hee is in, together with the profeſſed parentall application and challenge of it, as to him and his, hee may convey ſuch an externall right formerly mentioned. Nor is that abſurditie ours, that wee make ſuch viſible members of Chriſts church before calling, for if hee meane it of effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; he, if inviſible Church fellowſhip will come under that abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie too; unleſſe hee could wholly exclude hypocrites from viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches, or ſuppoſe ſuch a Church where neither are nor can come any falſe brethren. If hee intendeth it of externall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſo viſible beleevers and in churched parents Infants, are with and in their parents call, to the externall fellowſhip of Church-covenant, implicitely called with them. As before they were a farre off together from covenant and Church, ſo now are they made nigh together th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41963:37"/> upholding a nationall Church; hee knowes wee in <hi>New-England</hi> which hold the one, yet doe not maintaine the other in the uſuall ſenſe of a nationall Church. And this which hath been here ſaid alſo may anſwer that of <hi>I. S.</hi> that Infants have not union with Chriſt, as not having faith, and therefore may not have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Church-ordinances; if hee intend it of ſaving faith, his ſequele is weake, ſince many which doe not ſavingly beleeve are in reſpect of their in-being in the viſible Church, to which alſo Chriſt is head, in Chriſt as the head of that body, in which they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible members, whence alſo that <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. But to ſpeake to the propoſition it ſelfe, I ſay Infants without actuall faith, are of Chriſts body the Church, of which more afterwards, and ſo in Chriſt as the head of the viſible Church.

It was not (as ſome ſay) that they onely had a covenant of grace among them, which was made to ſome choyce ones among them, but that which was made with and diſpenſed to the body of the Jewes, was a covenant of works and not of grace; for the contrary appeareth, 1. In that the covenant was made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in reference to their whole ſeed at leaſt in reſpect of externall and eccleſiaſticall right, as before wee proved. And hence God appointed them all to receive the viſible ſeale thereof, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. and 26. 3, 4, 5. and 28. 12, 13, 14. either then theſe covenant fathers receiving the covenant in reference to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, had a contrary covenant of life and death, grace and works, made with them, and ſo at one and the ſame time were externally under the bleſſing and curſe of God, and ſo were not one root to their ſeed, nor firſt fruits of one ſort; but as their branches and lumpe in the body of them, are ſuppoſed to have the covenant of workes diſpenſed to them, ſo are they to them as a legall root and firſt-fruits of that ſort: yet ſundry of the branches being elect ones, to them they are an Evangelicall roote, and firſt-fruits of another ſort, contrary to that letter of the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. or if not both,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41963:37"/> then either receiving a covenant of workes alone, in reference to them all elected, or not: or it muſt be granted, that they received the covenant of grace with Eccleſiaſticall reſpect to them all.</p>
                     <p>2. The very ſubſtance of the covenant made and enjoyned to be ſealed upon all the children of thoſe fathers, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 8. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. was (as hath been proved) not a Legall but an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call covenant. It was not, Doe this and live, or elſe bee accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12. but I will bee a God to thy ſeed, not to <hi>Iſaac</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> alone; nor to <hi>Jacob</hi> of <hi>Iſaac</hi> alone, in that Church-right and way, but to thy ſeede in their generations. It was their covenant-right to have the Tabernacle of God, or Ordinances as their priviledge, yea and his preſence therein.

                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt was the mediator of that covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> made with them and ſo held out to them all, witneſſe their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices expiatory, and propitiatory, injoyned the whole congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in caſe of ſinne, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 13. unto 22. witneſſe the two Goates, one for a ſinne offering for the whole congregation, and the other the ſcape goate, over which all the ſinnes of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were confeſſed by the Prieſts, and then it was in a typicall way to carry away all their ſinnes, into a place farre remote, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 15, 21, 22, &amp;c. what this did externally ſignifie, none is ignorant which knowes the Scriptures. And albeit all made not effectuall uſe of it by ſaving faith, yet God herein teſtified what a covenant they were under, even that of grace confirmed in Chriſt, and to what they had according to men externall right. Hence the high Prieſt in type of Chriſt, bare the names of the 12. Tribes, and made interceſſion and atonement for them upon the like ground. <hi>Adam,</hi> with whom that covenant of workes was made, had no ſuch ſacrifices, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 17. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the promiſes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> not excluding this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. albeit more eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2. 31. ſaith not, they were [to bee confirmed] in Chriſt, as if not at all ratified in Chriſt to them of old: but ſaith the covenant [was confirmed] long before the Law in Chriſt, ſo as that could not diſanull the validitie of it, and <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 25. they are ſaid to bee children of the Goſpell promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3 hence <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 54, 55. 67, 68. unto the 76 Verſe, and Chriſt as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, not of circumciſing, for he neither circumciſed, nor baptized perſonally, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1. but of the circumciſion, that is the Jewiſh
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41963:38"/> Church and people, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 7. hee came actually and perſonally to confirme thoſe promiſes made to the fathers, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 7, 8. which hee had before virtually confirmed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 17. And which is obſervable, the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 9, 10, 11, 12. brings in foure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to prove the receiving in of the Gentiles to the fellowſhip of the covenant and Goſpel, as that which was oppoſed much, but to confirme that of the Jewiſh covenant eſtate, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. hee brings no further reaſon, then that, taken from one end of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh: as if to deny the former were to queſtion the later. And how can it bee imagined that ſuch an Evangelicall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. made with reference to them, ſhould bee made without reſpect to Chriſt, in whom ſalvation was really exhibited to the elect among them, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 23, 24 with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115 8. to 16. and 111. 3, 4 &amp; 44. 17, 18. 22 with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 36 <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>per totum. Johns</hi> converts were but turned to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or faith of their righteous fathers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 17 and to the reſt externally miniſtred in the viſible ſeales and types thereof; to ſhew, it was their viſible covenant and Church-right alſo, if they had hearts to improve it, and that they ſhould anſwer dearely for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting their owne mercy if deſpiſers, &amp;c. as they afterwards did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. hitherto was their injunction of the brazen Serpent, and their looking upon it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 7, 8, 9, 10. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the covenant of workes holds out no pardon or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to tranſgreſſors, as did this covenant made and diſpenſed to the Jewes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. as before wee ſhewed, ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the covenant of works required not either faith in Chriſt or repentance, thoſe Goſpel duties <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. but perfect perſonall obedience, much leſſe did it offer grace inabling to repent, but this their covenant did both require and offer the ſame, <hi>Deut.</hi> Chap. 30.

                     <p>Seventhly, all the Jewes beſt and worſt, had the ſame diſpenſers of the covenant, as their Miniſters in whom they were all intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and by whom they were miniſterially urged, with their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-right in common, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6. and 24. 7, 8. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17. 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. 16. and 44. 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 37. and 33. 25, 26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. 59. 60. 62. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 11.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, the covenant of works was made with all men without diſtinction in <hi>Adam,</hi> but this covenant was a peculiar covenant, made with the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as before was ſhewed.</p>

                     <p>Tenthly, the refuſe Jewes thus cut and caſt off, I demand from what they are caſt, and into what eſtate they are now put? to the former, none will ſay they are cut out and caſt off from a viſible right, or eſtate of a covenant of workes, and the diſpenſation thereof: that were well for them, if ſo: So then their former pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged eſtate for their covenant fathers, from which they were caſt by reaſon of unbeleefe, was not barely a ceremoniall yoake, the which our oppoſites urge as grievous to them all and a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge rather to bend thereof: Nor the bare ſubſervient covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> (as <hi>Cameron</hi> calleth it.) For firſt, the branch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they had in reference to thoſe covenant fathers, as

Now I demand, was this their priviledge eſtate in which they abode, an eſtate of a covenant of workes; or at beſt was it an eſtate of a ſubſervient <hi>Sinai</hi> covenant, as <hi>Cameron</hi> phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, the condition whereof was no other according to him, then do and live, or elſe die, which if ſo, was in effect as the covenant of workes ſtrictly taken, I ſuppoſe none will affirme that: verily then what ever ceremoniall vailes were ſuper-addded in <hi>Moſes</hi> dayes, yet that could not invalidate <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, in which they with the reſt of their fellow-members then caſt out, were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in common; albeit theſe had a more peculiar benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which the other fell ſhort of by that unbeleefe.</p>
                     <p>12. The Goſpelled Gentiles ſtood in that very condition by faith, and came into the very ſame kingdome eſtate, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or eſſentialls of it, out of which the worſer part of the Jewes, were broken and caſt, they were gaffed in <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

Therefore in the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls of that covenant eſtate the ſame. Laſtly, God remembred the worſt of them for good, when in the worſt eſtate by ſinne, and made it as I may ſay frequently a motive to himſelfe, to ſhew them this and that eſpeciall favour, even the reſpect to his covenant with them, and with their fathers in their ſtead. If this covenant made with them had beene as <hi>Adams</hi> or <hi>Sinai's</hi> covenant, in the legall part of it, a covenant of meere doing, and living by it, or elſe periſhing, &amp;c. that being minded by God, would have called for juſtice againſt them in their juſt deſtruction, and have urged God, even for reſpect to his juſtice, to have then cut off all ſuch Idolatrous Apoſtates. But verily, in that it was a covenant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayling for mercy and grace, rather to bee freely extended to them, albeit ſo unworthy, what was it other, then that free covenant of Gods grace, which when they failed of their part of the covenant in all Eccleſiaſticall reſpects, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. 59. 6, &amp;c. yet God will out of reſpect to his owne part of the covenant made with them, ſhew them favour? <hi>verſ.</hi> 60. 62, 63. ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. and 31, &amp;c.

Shee had her ceremonialls and moralls to regulate her Kings and Princes, Prieſts, Levites, and Elders, had their proper worke, and moved onely in their owne ſpheres. The Elders of the aſſemblies knew and acted in their places Eccleſiaſtically, without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from civill officers, or intruding upon civill offices, as ſuch, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. and 16. 1. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. the matters of the King and of the Lord, were carefully bounded and ſundred, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 11.</p>

Citing for that, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 9, 10, 11, 42. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 72, 73, 74. In token of which God annexed Circumciſion as a ſeale to confirme the ſame, Gen. 17. 11. And againe, unto which covenant circumciſion was added, to put the people alwayes in mind of the ſaid covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. and a ſeale to confirme the covenant on both ſides, God to be a God to them, as aforeſaid, and they to be his owne people above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſo to performe the ſame condition of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as <hi>Abraham</hi> their father did, and to walke as ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart, unto which they were ingaged by that ordinance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. otherwiſe that covenant ſtood not in force, &amp;c.</q> Firſt then, there was a covenant of grace, which onely
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41963:44"/> requireth faith and repentance, made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſo with the body of the Jewes, Infants and all, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then particulars of that ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in generall: God anexing circumciſion in token thereof as his mind touching them whilſt Infants, viſibly to confirme the ſame to them whether they proved elect or reprobate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. Secondly, then the Initiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeale of the covenant of grace, was not alwayes of preſent actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace in the party ſealed, but unto future grace, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of future actings of faith and repentance: Albeit, not then able practically and perſonally to reſtipulate otherwiſe then paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in their parents. It being confeſſed to bee a ſeale on both ſeeds of Gods being a God to them, &amp;c. And putting the people circumciſed in mind, <hi>ſcil.</hi> afterwards of the covenant, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the conditions of it, of faith, and repentance &amp;c. 3 Then circumciſion ſealed ſpirituall things, even that covenant [I will bee a God to them] and ſo fulfill my promiſes to them: ſuch like as <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 72, 73, 74. In token whereof circumciſion was annexed to confirme the ſame. And ſurely it confirming a promiſe of ſuch mercies as <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 72, &amp;c. it did confirme very ſpirituall things to them, and ſo not temporall things onely, as <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. as ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry have affirmed. Alſo, then circumciſion, ingaging the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed perſons to beleeve as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and to bee in heart cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, &amp;c. as <hi>I. S.</hi> cited that place for that purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. to the end: Hee elſe-where contradicteth himſelfe, affirming that faith in the bleſſed ſeed, was not required either in <hi>Abraham</hi> or others to be circumciſed. If it ingaged them to his faith, then hee and adult proſelytes ſtood prae-ingaged to the ſame faith. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Infants, albeit not actually beleeving at preſent, yet that ſeale was on them virtually, as a preſent ingagement to after faith &amp;c. Nor doth this accord with what <hi>I. S.</hi> elſewhere affirmeth, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion required, not the ſecond birth but firſt. Since, it inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the hearts circumciſion, this could not bee without a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth ſuppoſed. This which hath been ſaid, accordeth with much of that which wee ſpeake, touching baptiſme, that it ſealeth the covenant indefinitely to all ſorts, and that it ſealeth on Infants preſent federall Grace, and unto future grace: likewiſe unto growne ones, it ſealeth perſonall grace leſſe principally, covenant grace principally.</p>
                     <p>From what hath beene ſaid in this ſixth propoſition it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> loynes, were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41963:44"/> as well as their covenant and Church-ſeed as any others; <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7. and 26. 3, 4 and 28. 13, 14.</note> hence the covenant runs in the indefinite notion of ſeed, and the ſame ſeed to which <hi>Canaan</hi> was to bee given for an outward inheritance, whereof children were heires as well as parents; hence upon that ground of Gods being a covenant-God to them, was the injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their being ſealed by Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. hence in that way is the Covenant of grace renewed to all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in the termes of you and your ſeed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6.

Nor was it ſome bare tender, but it was in way of ſpeciall Covenant and oath on Gods part, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 14, 15. ſheweth, nay it was of a ſoveraigne nature, to bring about what God in his ſecret counſell intended, hence called a commandement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11. like that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 8. the covenant and the commanded word were one; and leſt any doubt ſhould ariſe, how this ſhould bee ratified and made good, <hi>Moſes</hi> prophetically ſetteth out Chriſt as dead and riſen in whom this covenant was virtually ratified, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. all which the Apoſtle further explaineth: when to ſet forth the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41963:45"/> way of Gods free Covenant grace in Chriſt without workes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. calling it the righteouſneſſe of faith or Covenant of grace in Chriſt, which juſtifying faith is to improve the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe: ſay not, who ſhall, &amp;c. where was this ſpoken, but in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14.

That the covenant intereſt of inchurched ſtipulating parents children is Goſpel. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Apoſtles preached this doctrine. Thirdly, that beleevers are to eye the Covenant in ſuch a latitude, as to their children with them by faith? Fourthly, that the eſſentials of the Covenant of grace, in the latitude of the extent thereof to covenant parents with their children, held forth in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was delivered and held forth as valid to the faith of the Saints in the new, and after Chriſts incarnation. This ſecond and fourth particular here mentioned might bee further confirmed both by rule, in that it being proved to bee Goſpel by the places now compared, it muſt needs bee, that the Apoſtles preached the ſame;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41963:45"/> being injoyned to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. unleſſe they either diſobeyed Chriſts charge; or hid ſome part of Gods Evangelicall mind from his people; contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. 18. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. 2 In that alſo <hi>Peter</hi> being to call upon his hearers to repent, and conſequently to beleeve, hee propounds the word of their faith in ſuch a Latitude as with reference to their children, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. The like doctrine doth <hi>Paul</hi> hold forth to the Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> and inchurched beleevers there touching ſuch children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14, 15. even touching the abounding of the graces of Chriſt to them. And the like virtually alſo is held forth by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16, 17, 18, 19. as elſewhere is proved, and ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, that which beleevers, as ſuch, have, doe and ought to beleeve as a branch of the covenant of grace, that is Goſpel; but this is of that nature, <hi>ergo.</hi> The major needs no proofe: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Texts alſo clearing the ſame: the minor, <hi>de jure,</hi> it's evident: they ought to beleeve the whole Covenant made with them, as is evident, faith muſt bee as large as it's object, the Covenant is the word of faith. A beleever in the exerciſe of faith ſhould as well have reſpect to the whole covenant, as in the exerciſe of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith; reſpect the whole word of commandement, hee doth not elſe beleeve rightly which doth not deſire and indeavour this: this therefore being one branch of Gods Covenant, to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as beleeving and inchurched, as theſe Scriptures compared ſhew they ought to beleeve this, which reſpecteth their ſeed, as well as that which reſpecting themſelves if they beleeve aright. God in making a covenant, in a Church reference eſpecially, as was that with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7. hee taketh in their ſeed or children as joynt covenanters. Hence the phraſe of ſeed in their generations: taking in parents generating and children begotten, as thoſe in and by whom Churches are likely to bee continued; whence God, when to ſpeake in reference to the Church ſeed, as well as to the choyce elect ſeed of <hi>Iſaccs</hi> line in which the viſible, and not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inviſible Church was to bee continued, hee ſaith, hee will eſtabliſh his covenant with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> not with <hi>Iſhmael; Iſhmael</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed too, and therefore externally in the covenant, and therefore ſealed; but God knowing that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> would reject this, hee warneth <hi>Abraham</hi> of it a little before, that it might not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him afterwards: It is not to bee with him in his generations: for that cauſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 18. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. but with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his generations; God not oppoſing therein <hi>Iſaac</hi>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:41963:46"/> to his Church-ſeed, but to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who by rejecting the covenant will and did come, hee and his to bee caſt out; hence when God ſpeaketh in reference to our times after Chriſts incarnation when a woman compaſt a man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 22. hee ſaith, hee will bee a God, not to the families in <hi>Judah</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> meerly, but to thoſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the earth. It's the old phraſe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant expounded and enlarged: I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed, in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Hee ſaith not barely, to thee and to thy ſeed in regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but, in their generations. Now in that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed were to bee gentile believers alſo, in their generations: in <hi>Jeremy</hi> it is, I will bee a God to the families of all the earth, <hi>ſcil.</hi> where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhall take ſo farre place to bring on the parent or parents to him and to his Church; not but that it may fall out, that in a beleevers family, ſome may come to hate their parents, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. for Religion, yet ordinarily it ſhould bee and is otherwiſe; and God ſpeaketh of things as they ordinarily come to paſſe: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes breake not ſquare here. Yet even in that caſe too it followeth not but that the children were externally in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Church eſtate when very children: But apoſtatiſing when growne up, they prove the deſperateſt enemies to the Goſpel, even to perſecute their owne parents. So it may bee the wife may remaine a Pagan, and ſo an enemy. But uſually the Goſpell when it commeth ſeaſoneth the wife as well as the husband, and ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as well as maſters. Hence ſuch frequent mention in holy ſtory, when ſpeaking of perſons which had families to whom the Apoſtles came, that their families were Goſpelled as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; witneſſe that of <hi>Cornelius, Stephanus, Criſpus,</hi> and the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, &amp;c. And even <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> deny it not to bee verified in all the adult perſons of the families mentioned uſually: then by their owne confeſſion wives and ſervants were uſually others at preſent, at leaſt then Pagans, or perſecuters, which ſufficeth to for anſwer <hi>Hen. Dens</hi> objection, touching the deſparitie of yokefellowes or maſters and ſervants. It was uſually otherwiſe, and God ſpeakes of things as they uſually prove: extraordinary occurrents croſſe not ſuch a rule, hence that teſtimony of the Angell to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 11. Hee ſhall ſpeake words unto thee whereby thou and all thy houſe ſhall bee ſaved, <hi>verſe</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe runs in that notion, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhall bee ſaved, and thy houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. ſo Chriſts teſtimony is to like purpoſe, This day is ſalvation come to this houſe, inaſmuch as he alſo is become a ſon of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41963:46"/> 
                        <hi>Abraham;</hi> where by the comming of ſalvation to the houſe, hee doth not meane the bare comming of Chriſt, who is called the ſalvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 30. to the materiall houſe of <hi>Zachaeus,</hi> as if that were ſuch a notable priviledge of <hi>Zacheus</hi> as a beleever; ſince Chriſt went to many other houſes then ſuch as were the beleeving ſons of <hi>Abraham, Luke</hi> 14. 1. and 7. 36. 39. and yet no ſuch ſingular note upon the ſame as here. Nor by ſalvation come to his houſe is meant the comming of ſalvation to himſelfe: as if hee and his houſe were all one: nor doe I know any parallel Scripture ſpeaking in ſuch language, that when the ſcope and intent is to mention the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of ſuch or ſuch a mercy to ſuch a perſon, that phraſe is uſed to denote the ſame; that ſuch or ſuch a mercy is come to his houſe. What need ſuch a circumlocution? If ſo intended, the word might more plainely have been ſet downe, this day is ſalvation come to this Publican, this perſon, this man, or the like, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as hee alſo is become a ſonne of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And what though the Greeke word bee uſed in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 45. and 4. 35. for <hi>ſecundum</hi> according as, yet not for <hi>quatenus</hi> or <hi>in quantum:</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as; the Texts and ſenſe thereof are cleare, that it noteth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſuch adminiſtration, not meerly the cauſe or reaſon thereof. Or if it be ſuppoſed to imply the cauſe or reaſon thereof, it's evident it noteth the proportion alſo, they gave to every one as, or according as the needed, <hi>ſcil.</hi> proprortionably to their need: It being regular as to give to the needy, ſo to give them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of their preſent neceſſitie. But how that ſenſe will here bee fitly applicable I ſee not, to ſay that ſalvation is come to his houſe or to him according as hee is a beleever, but rather as our tranſlaters render it, it's to be taken as a reaſon of the former, ſalvation is come to this houſe foraſmuch as he is a ſonne of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Yea, but will it not then follow that one mans faith ſaveth others as well as himſelfe? No verily. <hi>Paul</hi> when hee ſpake ſo to the Jaylor, If thou beleeveſt thou ſhalt bee ſaved and thy houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. hee ſpeakes more likely to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as it may ſeeme; yet verily hee entended not any ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of others being actually ſaved onely by his faith; but that hee imbracing the covenant of grace in Chriſt, and by faith laying hold of the ſame, his whole houſe, even wife or ſervants and all (as it is uſuall) ſhall fare the better, and come in the Goſpels way: but if hee have children which are the continuers and upholders of the houſe in eſpeciall, there is a more direct Covenant-line, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41963:47"/> therefore ordinary meanes of ſalvation runs unto them by virtue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, and ſo if hee beleeve, not barely in the Lord Jeſus, without reference to the promiſe, but as held out in the promiſe of ratifying of the promiſe, or covenant of grace, in this ſenſe his houſe, Synecdochically, ſhall be ſaved, and brought within this covenant road and ordinary meane of ſalvation. None ordinarily can be ſaved but in ſuch a way. It's the word of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which muſt inſtrumentally bee effectuall thereto, that is Gods order, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26. and ſo in the eaſe of <hi>Zacheus;</hi> whence that periphraſis of his being a beleever, that hee was become a ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo an heire of <hi>Abrahams</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. Nor is this ſenſe of ſalvation, for covenant meanes of ſalvation, or the covenant and promiſe it ſelfe unuſuall in Scripture. The ſalvation which Chriſt and his Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. neglected, was not barely ſalvation it ſelf, but the promiſes holding the ſame forth, for <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 28. the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to bee ſent and heard by the gentiles was the promiſes, and covenant and Goſpell holding the ſame forth, this was that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and riches, and ſalvation alſo which came to the Gentiles, as rejected by the Jewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11, 12, 17. 19 30. Verſes compared. So <hi>Eſay</hi> 51. 6. 8. Gods ſalvation is his promiſe, or covenant on which their ſalvation did depend, <hi>Calvin in locum.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of his houſe or poſteritie, which albeit it were not ſo orient then, yet God had made a covenant with him, <hi>ſcil</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his houſe ordered in all things and ſure; And this, <hi>ſcil.</hi> this covenant with mee and my houſe, is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, albeit he maketh my houſe not to grow or flouriſh in ſuch ſort: this covenant then was his ſalvation, <hi>objective cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter</hi> or <hi>Inſtrumentaliter.</hi> Albeit a parents faith bee not a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe, yet it may bee an occaſionall meanes to ſtave off deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from and to further the ſalvation of their children; hence the faith of <hi>Moſes</hi> parents preſerved him in the waters, when a babe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 23. hence that typicall ſprinkling of the houſes, repreſenting the preſervation of the firſt born, from other manner of deſtruction then meerely bodily: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> his faith with other beleeving <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> as <hi>verſe</hi> 27. 25. compared ſheweth, had a great ſtroake therein. And the like in that typicall paſſage of theirs with their children through the red Sea, <hi>verſe</hi> 28. As much might bee ſaid of that caſe of the beleeling <hi>Ninivites, Jon.</hi> 3. and 4. So in that typicall ſaving of <hi>Noahs</hi> houſe by <hi>Noahs</hi> faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. But to returne to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41963:47"/> houſes mentioned, ſhall it then be yeelded, that ſuch benefit ſhould come as was before ſpoken of, to adult ſervants of the houſe, &amp;c. &amp; is here no reference to the poor babes by reaſon of their tender age? hath the mercifull God revealed no ordinary helpe for them? They are excluded from that actuall rejoycing and beleeving Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. whence Anabaptiſts doe therefore exclude them from the baptized houſe of the Jaylour; and why not as well exclude them by reaſon of want of actuall faith, from the ſaved houſe of the Jaylour? <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. which I ſuppoſe they will not doe. Nay, why not rather ſo? ſince it's peremptorily ſaid, He that beleeveth not ſhall bee damned; and, Without faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. when it's no where ſaid that, without faith it's impoſſible to bee baptized; or, hee that beleeveth not ſhall never bee baptized. Surely the Apoſtle adding that as an incouragement to the troubled Jaylour to beleeve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſaving of his houſe in ſuch ſort at leaſt as wee mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it had beene little incouragement to ſuppoſe an outward way and meane of the good of his very ſervants by occaſion thereof, and no ſuch meane at all thereby to his owne children. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh as ſuppoſing even that alſo: children being moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuppoſed to bee included in that notion of the houſe: and if hee had none, yet the Apoſtles ſpeech reacheth them as if hee had them. Some will ſay, the children might bee elected and that might comfort him: or they might bee included amongſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by Chriſt. Yea, but theſe are all ſecrets, here is nothing viſibly to comfort him, in reſpect of any inſtrumentall meanes of their good; as was intimated in the caſe of the ſervants. And they are revealed, not ſecret things which beleevers as ſuch muſt looke to in reſpect of their children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. Nor is it expreſly ſaid that the Jaylours houſe beleeved before they were baptized, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; and ſuppoſe they did ſo before, yet it followeth not that what is applicable to the adult perſons in the houſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that joy of faith, muſt exclude the children of the houſe from baptiſme, whereof they were capable; no more then when it's ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 7. that they and their houſholds were to eate before the Lord and to rejoyce in all they put their hands to, &amp;c. becauſe therefore their little children could not ſo actually expreſſe joy in what they put their hand unto, therefore they were none of the houſhold which did eate before the Lord. Anabaptiſts would not like this arguing: which urge the joynt communion of the Jewiſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41963:48"/> in all ſorts of Church ordinances. Suppoſe a mans houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, men, women and children, all diſeaſed and cured at the Bath, and afterwards the houſhold expreſſeth their joy for it by leaping and dancing for joy; and it bee ſaid, ſuch a man, hee and all his were waſhed at ſuch a Bath, and hee and his whole houſhold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards even danced for joy: None will ſay, that becauſe his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones could not ſo leape for joy, and are excluded from the notion of the [whole houſhold] in this latter, therefore they were not in the account of [all his] in the former. Who will ſay that <hi>Jacob</hi> carried not the little children in his family to <hi>Bethel,</hi> from that imminent danger to his houſe, becauſe that the houſhold at <hi>Bethel</hi> are ſaid to bee ſuch which had their ſtrange gods, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his motion they put them away, which is not applicable to little ones, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 30. with Chap. 35. 1, 2, 3, 4. Sure I am it's moſt uſuall in Scripture in mentioning this and that as done in or to the houſe, when ſpeaking of ſuch things which are applicable to Infants, to intend them therein, albeit not expreſſed, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 30. and 45. 11. 18. with 19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 1. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 42. It would bee too much to cite the many Scriptures which ſpeake this; nay the Scripture oft-times in ſuch things under the notion of houſe intendeth, if not onely, yet chiefly the children in it, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 15. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 12, 13. 15. compared, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1. 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Eſay</hi> 31. 2. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 9, 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4, 5. and 5. 4. 8. compared, alſo <hi>verſe</hi> 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. And ſometimes againe when ſome parts of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are expreſly inſtanced in, and children not withall mentioned: yet they are included and intended, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 16. And there is more reaſon to conceive the ſame in caſes of this nature; ſince the children are the ordinary inſtruments as to perpetuate and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and hold up the houſe in naturall and civill reſpects, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Church reſpects alſo; they are builders of the houſe both wayes, as the Hebrew radix [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

Thus much for further clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that, ſo much queſtioned by ſome, how children are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that notion of houſe and families, and if ſo the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

God found him in <hi>Bethel</hi> and there hee ſpake [with us.] As much might be ſaid of that, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 4, 5. the covenant was made with <hi>David</hi> the father: yet in reference to his houſe or children, whence it was that his faith, as a beleeving father of his family, was the evidence of things not ſeene. Hee beleeveth that whatever his houſe bee at preſent, yet it ſhall excell in grace, both of Gods feare and juſtice, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. as in the glory of government, &amp;c. nor was this other then a covenant of grace here mentioned, ſince it had not elſe been to him as all his deſire and ſalvation; whence it was that in ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt times this covenant was pleaded by the Prophets, in behalfe of <hi>Davids</hi> poſteritie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>verſ.</hi> 38, 39. 49. 50. ſee more, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. 28. and ſo on: if the parents and the children both may thus act forth, and muſt in the covenant ſo made, it's a ſigne parents and children were joyntly intereſted therein. And ſo I come to inſtance as well in ſuch as <hi>de facto</hi> have done ſo, as to ſhew, <hi>de jure</hi> they ſhould doe it; to let paſſe <hi>Davids</hi> example here, the inſtance of our grandmother <hi>Eve</hi> is paſt exception: her ſonne <hi>Cain</hi> being diſcovenanted and diſcharged hee and his, and <hi>Abel</hi> ſlaine, ſhee beleeved the promiſe of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. at firſt made to her: and when infant <hi>Seth</hi> was borne, ſhee beleeved that God had for his covenant ſake lookt on her in that covenant babe: and therefore as ſoone as borne, ſhe calls his name <hi>Seth:</hi> for ſaith ſhee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41963:49"/> God hath appointed mee another ſeed in ſtead of <hi>Abel</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 25. ſhee ſpake not thus, in reference to him, as a meere naturall babe borne of her as a ſinfull woman, but as of a Covenant and Church ſeed, therefore comparing him to <hi>Abel,</hi> not to <hi>Cain:</hi> and calls him by ſuch a name as ſignified her faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant eſtate of this babe, even whilſt a very babe; nor did ſhee faile in her faith therein as appeares by the ſequell, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. whence the Church ſeed continued in his loynes, externally at leaſt, albeit much degenerating, as that diſtinction of ſonnes of God and daughters of men doth ſhew, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 1, 2. And as <hi>Eve</hi> beleeved this way, ſo did <hi>Lamech, Gen.</hi> 5. 28, 29. as ſoone as <hi>Noah</hi> was borne, hee from ſaith in that promiſe of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <note n="*" place="margin">See Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva Bible notes on the place.</note> gave the babe that name of <hi>Noah;</hi> beleeved that that child ſhould bee a root, as it were, to the Church, albeit that corrupt world were to bee deſtroyed. Another example of the Saints faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their childrens federall eſtate, ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25, 26, 27. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. which referred unto Chriſt as in whom they pleaded, and expected this touching their children. And it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that thoſe Saints did expreſſe their faith in Chriſt, touching their children and ſeeds being eſtabliſhed before him, nor did they exerciſe their faith touching the vaniſhing temporall good of their children barely, <hi>verſ</hi> 25, 26. but in reference to induring mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Chriſt to them, laſting when heaven and earth ſhould diſſolve. Now did they take the riſe of this their faith from poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of election or redemption without foothold from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? verily no, they ought not to ground their faith on any thing but God his revealed will touching themſelves or theirs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. the Covenant and promiſe, is that which faith in its acts of beleeving, doth build, and reſt upon, and faith, albeit it muſt goe as farre, yet no further that way then the word of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. ſecrets of poſſibilities of election, and redemption of the children would not, might not, have cauſed in them, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive apprehenſion of faith, but the revealed covenant, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and will of Gods grace in Chriſt, election and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though things which faith beleeveth, yet not grounds in themſelves conſidered without reference to the covenant revealed of any mans faith touching himſelfe or others, as being ſecrets; It's not the election of faith, but the word of faith, nor beleefe of election as ſuch: for as ſuch it's a ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> act of God: hid within himſelfe; but the beleefe of the truth, or revealed promiſe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41963:49"/> argument of the federall intereſt of beleevers Infants to bee Goſpell, and therefore of perpetuall validitie, now as well as at any time, may be, in that it was held forth as Goſpel in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, and ſo will bee in the purer times of the Goſpell, towards the very end of the world, and therefore it's Goſpell to us now. The conſequence is evident, both from the everlaſtingneſſe of the Goſpell, and covenant of grace, of which this was, and will bee made a branch, which covenant of grace is Goſpell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 6. and from the eſſentiall ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and oneneſſe of the covenant of grace from the beginning of the world to the end: for ſo farre forth as any thing partaketh of everlaſtingneſſe, it partaketh ſo farre of immutabilitie. Now the covenant is not in nature the ſame, if the covenant, the confederate perſons are not ſpecifically the ſame, the covenant in the nature of it ſuppoſing God as one partie, and ſuch or ſuch a ſort of perſons as other parties betwixt whom that covenant is drawn, and made; if it were ſuppoſable that there were not the ſame God covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with man, or not the ſame ſorts of perſons, ſpecifically accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by God into termes of covenant grace with him, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were not in nature the ſame. Albeit it bee not ſhut up in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as of old in <hi>Adams, Seths, Enoſhes, Kenans, Mahaleels, Jareds, Enochs, Methuſelahs, Lamechs, Noahs, &amp;c.</hi> or in the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> &amp; <hi>Jacob,</hi> in reſpect of Church intereſt in, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it, but inlarged to all the families of Goſpeld per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet if the perſons admitted to covenant, bee not ſpecifically the ſame, even that ſort of inadult, as well as adult perſons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther male or female, bond or free, then is not the covenant in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the ſame. Now to prove the propoſition in both its branches; and firſt that it was held forth as Goſpell, that the ſpecies of the Infants of beleevers in Church-eſtate were taken into the verge of the covenant of grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. ſheweth. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were eyed by God, as a ſeminall viſible Church, by whom, as well the Church, as the world was to bee built up, and God, that he might eſpecially glorifie his grace, even in the weakeſt, mentioneth <hi>Eve</hi> as one, touching whom, hee firſt expreſſed his revealed minde of grace to her, and her ſeed, not intending meerely the principall ſeed Chriſt, in and by whom it was ratified, and fulfilled, but her Church ſeed whom the ſame promiſe alſo did comprehend toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Eve,</hi> in whoſe hearing, God uttered theſe things to the Serpent. And hence <hi>Eve,</hi> by faith did thus interpret the ſcope
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41963:50"/> of that promiſe, as made in refernce to her Infant Church ſeed, as was <hi>Seth,</hi> as before wee proved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 25, 26. And the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſheweth what kind of ſeed the promiſe reached, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Infant, as well as adult ſeed, the Serpents ſeed being as well the leaſt Snake, &amp;c. as the moſt venemous, and overgrowne; and the antipathie being naturall and forcible betweene even little children, and any ſort of Serpents, as is evident, this then was held out as Goſpel, even in the beginning of the viſible Church and world: hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the beginning of the renewed world, as I may call it, after the flood, the ſame doctrine is implicitely held forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. in the oppoſition of the ſervill condition of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or 25, 26. to the future Church eſtate of <hi>Japhet, verſ.</hi> 27. the one accurſed parent and child to ſervitude, ſo that <hi>Chams</hi> babes as ſoone as borne were to bee ſlaves, but <hi>Japhet,</hi> parent and child, are prophetically devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Church eſtate in <hi>Sems</hi> Tents, ſo that inchurched <hi>Japhets</hi> babes are actually within <hi>Sems</hi> tents, ſo ſoone as borne; As God would accurſe collective <hi>Canaan, Noah</hi> propheſieth that God would inlarge, or cauſe collective <hi>Japhet</hi> to turne into the Tents of <hi>Sem;</hi> which interpreters expound of the joyning of the Gentiles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the viſible Church. Now viſible Church eſtate, ſuppoſeth viſible covenant eſtate, as is evident. The like oppoſition was allegorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made in the primitive times after Chriſts aſcenſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23, 24. betweene collective naturall <hi>Iſhmael</hi> of the bond-woman in type, and collective legall <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> in antitype: And collective naturall <hi>Iſaac</hi> in type, and collective Evangelicall <hi>Iſaac</hi> in antitype. In the types, the oppoſition is undeniably verified: that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> with his children are expunged and caſt out from a civill family priviledge, and portion in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe; and onely <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his children are to have that civill and naturall priviledge of inheritance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: The ſonne of the bondwoman ſhall not bee heire with my ſon <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 21. 10. And in the antitype, even perſons formerly in Gods family the Church, if rejecting Chriſt and the covenant in him, and imbracing and adhering obſtinately to any thing in a way inconſiſtent with him, ſuch are caſt out, and diſchurched, they and theirs, as was verified in that legall <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and her children, even the body of the Jewes, adult and Infant. Thus far <hi>à typo ad veritatem,</hi> the argument is undeniable; and what reaſon then to make the other branch of the allegory diſſonant onely, that there <hi>à typo ad veritatem,</hi> the argument holdeth not, that all inchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched perſons, which are goſpelled, hold forth the free covenant in

It was that God might ſhew, not barely in the act of his chooſing of them in his ſecret counſell, but in the act of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting grace likewiſe, that it was not of their workes but of him that called them unto that covenant eſtate: in the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> moſt fully; when God would ſhew the riſe of that his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grace to him the younger, that hee ſhould have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. hee <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. inſtanceth in the time when that was revealed, with ſo perſonall a reference to <hi>Jacob,</hi> even whilſt in the wombe, and expreſſeth the forenamed cauſe as the reaſon why: and ſo God expreſly mentioneth his covenant as to bee eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in Infancy, or with <hi>Iſaac</hi> to bee borne the next yeare of <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 17. 21.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41963:52"/> hee doth not retract any thing, but confirmeth in ſolemne wiſe the validitie of the former bond, and the like might bee ſaid of all the reſt of the elect ſeed: if all the elect ſeed were not involved in that covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 7. then the Apoſtles reaſoning ſhould bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. who is ſo farre from denying the elect ſeed to bee theſe choyce children of the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and 21. 12. that he maketh that choyce company of the children of the promiſe to bee the onely elect ſeed; now if all the elect ſeed bee included in that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and 21. 12. then ſince ſome of <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſeed died in Infancie, either none of thoſe were elect and ſaved, which none dare avow, or if ſome bee ſuppoſed to bee ſaved and elect, then were they in Infancie, and as Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> children of the promiſe; Sith the promiſe and covenant runs to them as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, not as elect, alſo ſuppoſing they were circumciſed before they died, that was no ſeale to a blanke, albeit they being Infants had no actuall faith, &amp;c. but rather a ſeale of the covenant of grace or promiſe, of which they moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly were children. Yea to all the reſt which were in an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall reſpect, children of the covenant: that injoyned circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be that his covenant or the viſible Sacramentall ſigne and ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, or the covenant of God hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. and 10. 6, 7, 8. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and 30. 6. 11. 12, 13, 14. compared.

And albeit it were a name given him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was actually circumciſed, yet it was not to intimate that there was no need of a viſible ſeale to his children and ſeed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his loynes or otherwiſe, for hee was a father aſwell of thoſe of the circumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11, 12. But to ſhew that hee was not a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41963:52"/> father to thoſe which were bound to bee circumciſed onely, but withall, a father to the Gentiles, albeit neither circumciſed by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all taking away of the fleſh of their foreskinne, nor yet bound thereto, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. It was not then ſpoken to evacuate the force of reaſoning from right to the promiſe, as inveſted, or Church promiſe or covenant unto right to the ſeale, or to ſhew that albeit Gentile beleevers did not partake of the initiatory ſeale of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet having the promiſe they therefore have the ſeale in <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, albeit they never are, nor may bee ſealed in their perſons; the Apoſtles diſcourſe cleareth it to bee otherwiſe, his ſcope being not to infringe any Goſpel right to the Goſpell ſeale, but to take off any reaſoning in point of juſtification from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny work of the Law conſidered apart from Chriſt; as the five firſt verſes evince: and becauſe that of circumciſion was chiefely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in by the Jewes, hee taketh off any reaſoning that way in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to faith which is all in all rather, in point of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether of Jewes or Gentiles; for which end <hi>Abrahams</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the way, and manner of his juſtification is propounded, as <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. declare, as for the ſealing of <hi>Abrahams</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers children the Gentiles, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſealing, if that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as much might have been affirmed of the beleevers Jewiſh children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they were ſuch, and ſo the circumciſing of ſuch Jewes, at leaſt, had been more then needed, ſo farre forth. Yea but the Jewes were commanded to be circumciſed; true, and ſo were the Gentiles to be baptized: yea but they were to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, when Infants; yea, and when adult too, in caſe, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> 5. and in that caſe at leaſt many of them, being actuall beleevers, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> 5. and 6. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 30. might have pleaded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, as being, <hi>quatenus</hi> beleever, circumciſed in the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their father <hi>Abraham.</hi> It was not then ſpoken at all to weaken the bond to an initiatory ſealing of Gentiles, but to [that] initiatory ſealing up of the covenant to them by circumciſion of the foreskin of their fleſh; thus much by the way in anſwer to what ſome thus object. But to returne to the proofe of that propounded, let us ſhew that even in the dayes ſince the time of the fathers before Chriſts time, ſuch children mentioned were, are, and will be eyed by divine approbation as covenant and Church-ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God hath promiſed to bleſſe the inchurched nations in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed Chriſt; behold Chriſt by an outward Symbole teſtifying that the little ones of inchurched viſible beleevers are in Church account
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41963:53"/> ſuch, witneſſe that act of his, and his offence that any ſuch ſhould bee hindred from any approach to him, in the uſe of any meanes to attaine, at leaſt externally, that bleſſing of him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeed, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15, 16. 7. with <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 16. hence in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer dayes of the Goſpel: It was of old propheſied that ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould bee accounted the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as their parents ſhould come under that account, by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Gentiles, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 9. yea God himſelfe expreſſeth his account as of ſuch parents ſo of their children, to be ſuch Church and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſeed: both are under one account ſo far forth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 23. beſides, that if ſuch parents, ſuppoſe Jewes or Gentiles, be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirituall ſeed, Anabaptiſts will grant, then are their children alſo; the parents being not meerely abſtractively conſidered, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. but as in reference to their children with them, for the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom the covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. is made, is the ſeed in their generations, which neceſſarily imply, and ſuppoſe as the parents generating, ſo the children begotten of them, the parents make not the generation alone, nor the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alone, but joyntly conſidered together. Here Anabaptiſts ſever the ſubject parties taken into the covenant conſideration, they agree it's <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſpirituall ſeed, but leave out that notation of the ſeed, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſeed in their generations, the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte gentiles in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, they were not his carnall ſeed; why are they then ſealed? but as they were rather <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Church ſeed. Yea but their babes alſo have the viſible ſeale of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, yet are they not his fleſhly ſeed: nor yet are they his actuall beleeving ſeed, and yet have they the feale of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, ſurely then, in and with their parents they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church and ſpirituall ſeed. You will ſay, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be ſealed, and therefore ſealed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe it ſo, yet God commanded their circumciſion to be on them, alſo his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or the Sacramentall ſigne of that his covenant ſealed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> &amp; to his ſeed, in their generation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. either then they which in one ſenſe were not of his ſeed or loynes, <hi>v.</hi> 12. yet were of his covenant and Church ſeed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. or elſe God ſolemnly enjoyned a ſeale to a blanke or a ſeale to no covenant of his: no other covenant being then in mention to bee ſealed, by circumciſion which was enjoyned to bee his covenant or the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſigne of his covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12, 13. Yea but they parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not of the covenant, many of them at leaſt, in their Infancy.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If yee ſpeake of ſaving actuall efficacy upon them, then neither did many others, no not of the elect ſeed which lived to maturitie of yeares, ſo partake of the covenant in their Infancy, nor doth that hinder but that circumciſion in the nature of it, and in the inſtitution of it, was a viſible ſeale of the covenant of grace, that which <hi>Moſes</hi> phraſeth touching circumciſion, that it was a ſigne of the covenant, <hi>Paul</hi> explaineth, that it was a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith; <hi>ſcil.</hi> not ſo much, <hi>ſubjective</hi> as <hi>objective, Rom.</hi> 4. The baptiſme of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in the nature of it, and in Gods inſtitution, a viſible ſeale of the moſt ſpirituall part of the covenant, and yet did not <hi>Iſcariot</hi> and <hi>Magus</hi> partake of the ſpirituall part of the Covenant. It is peculiar to the elect to bee in the covenant, in reſpect of participation of the ſaving efficacy of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. But it is common to <hi>Iſcariot,</hi> and reprobates, adult or Infants, to bee externally in the covenant in the face of the Church; as <hi>verſe</hi> 4. of which before. But as for the viſible ſeale it ſelfe, whether to elect, or reprobate, to ſuch as partake of the ſpirituall good of the covenant, or not; this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, nor multiplyeth, nor nullifieth the nature of the ſeale. The nature of it depends on God the author, not upon the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led perſons worthineſſe, or unworthineſſe, ſex or age. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was not covenants, but one and the ſame covenant, <hi>ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura rei,</hi> nor was it a part, but the covenant, even the whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Sacramentally, to elect or reprobate Infant or adult cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. The commandement of God did not put, or cauſe any difference, but injoyned it all equally to all ſorts. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſealed was but one, not two covenants: albeit, God did hold forth varietie of covenant bleſſings, as doth the Goſpell; ſome more common to all, and ſome more peculiar to a few; and ſo the ſeale it ſelfe was to Infant and adult, elect or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but one in nature: albeit in uſe and efficacy it were various, according as the Spirit of God and faith made thereof improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or not.</p>
                     <p>To adde one word more in way of proofe, that Gentile-inchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched-beleevers Infants they are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> this being wholly denyed by Anabaptiſts. If I prove that this ſpecies or ſort of perſons, are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirituall ſeed, without perſonall actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith, by which onely they ſay perſons come to bee <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, quoting for it <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. 6. 9. 16. 27, 28, 29. it ſufficeth. Now the place to mee is full proofe thereof: whole Chriſt myſticall,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41963:54"/> in all the parts of his body, the Apoſtle maketh it to bee the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that ſort of perſons the Infants of beleevers are a part of Chriſt myſticall, or Chriſt conſidered with his body the Church, as Chriſt is in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. compared, as hath beene proved, <hi>Ergo</hi> that ſort of perſons as well that other of actuall beleevers are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirituall ſeed. And here ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing according to them, that Chriſt is conſidered there as with his body, the inviſible Church; it maketh ſtill more for what I am to prove: ſince, if that ſort of perſons bee not of the inviſible Church whereof Chriſt is head, there can none of that ſort, not beleevers children at all bee ſaved; ſince out of the inviſible Church is no ſalvation at all, as ſome of the moſt judicious of our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites doe ſpeake, in way of anſwer to what is brought by our friends, that <hi>extra eccleſiam non eſt ſalus,</hi> that is, ſay ſuch, <hi>extra ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam inviſibilem, non viſibilem.</hi> But wee will goe yet further, and take this as meant of Chriſt conſidered with his body the viſible Church, according as formerly it was proved to bee conſiderable: And I ſay, to exelude that ſort of perſons, <hi>ſcil.</hi> beleevers infants, from being a part of the viſible Church in generall: is to exclude them from any ordinary ſtate and way of ſalvation, Nay I will go further, and ſay; that for any to ſuppoſe all the individuall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and each of them which come of ſuch inchurched parents, not to bee alſo parts of this body of Chriſt the viſible Church, and conſequently, not to bee <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirituall ſeed, is to exclude them from a ſtate and way of ſalvation, in reſpect to the ordinary courſe thereof, and ſo to leave them all under the conſideration of ſuch a way to bee ſaved in, as is onely extraordinary: ordinarily they are not to bee ſuppoſed to bee ſaved, as at leaſt it is not to be ſuppoſed, that ordinarily or that in any ordinary way, any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, or Turkes, out of the viſible Church, or any in and of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Tridentine, and Antichriſtian, ſhould bee ſaved: yet God may, and ſometimes doth, and will have ſome ſoules brought on to him thence, and even from amongſt <hi>Mahumetans, &amp;c.</hi> but all will yeeld I ſuppoſe that this is an extraordinary caſe: &amp; ſo croſſeth not that rule, that without even the viſible Church there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>ſcil.</hi> taking the maxime in reference to ordinary times, and withall to the ordinary courſe and way of attaining unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Such then as exclude all Infants of beleevers, one or other from the notion of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirituall ſeede, from Covenant and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41963:54"/> Church eſtate, they put them in the Pagan Gentiles eſtate, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, who being they and theirs ſtrangers from the promiſe and covenants, and from the viſible Church: they place them in that reſpect in an eſtate of perſons that are without God in the world, and ſo under the devill the God of the world, and in an hopeleſſe eſtate; neither they nor any for them, can have any grounded hope of them, they are without hope, in regard at leaſt of any ordinary way or meane of ſalvation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Nor let it ſeeme grievous that our friends and brethren in the Lord, of name and worth in the Church, have, as it ſeemeth, urged, that in caſe of ſuch an excluſion of beleevers children, they are made as Turkes or Indians ſo farre forth, in regard that being not in covenant, nor Church eſtate, the Apoſtle truely ſtates ſuch perſons caſes, they are without hope, and without God in the world. Hee maketh no diſtinction of <hi>potentia remota &amp; propinqua,</hi> in that caſe. Yea but hee ſpeakes of Pagan parents, wee of Chriſtian, and there is not the ſame reaſon of the childrens eſtate which are of the one, as of the other. Tell me the difference ſuppoſing them actually excluded from covenant and Church eſtate. It is not in their parents prayers, or in the Churches nakedly conſidered, without reference to any covenant or Church eſtate of theirs: for they pray as well for Indians, &amp;c. as for them. Nor is it barely in their inſtruction, and education of them: for if they have any Indian or Black more bond ſervants in their houſe, they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct both them and their children in Gods feare as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable thereof. Yea but for the one their prayers and inſtructions, come from a nearer bond, and are carried on with more ſtrength, then in the other: grant that, yet this is but more and leſſe, and they vary no ſpecies of any formall reaſon of difference; yea but they may beleeve more for the one then for the other: and why ſo? becauſe uſually the one ſort prove religious, when the other is not uſuall. This confirmeth what I am to prove, that God is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God to the children of his people, and Church; becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſometimes ſome prove vile enough, yet uſually they prove religious and pious: and God ſpeakes of things as they more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove. Yea I demand, what is the ordinary revealed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall meanes of the ſaving efficacy which is upon any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Gods people and Church, eſpecially ſuppoſing they die very young: is it not the word of Gods covenant as hath beene often ſaid from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. Yea I would know
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41963:55"/> whether if beleevers have hope, to take hope moſt properly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their childrens good, or glorious reſurrection by Chriſt, if they die in Infancy, have they other ground then that of Gods being a God to them? This is Chriſts demonſtration in that caſe: <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 36, 37, 38. Is it any other then Scripture hope or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that way, or muſt they ſorrow as perſons without hope? If they draw any waters with joy, <hi>Eſay</hi> 12. 3. muſt it not bee out of the wells of ſalvation, the promiſes? not other promiſes which concerne not the caſe, they will not helpe at ſuch a dead lift, but promiſes pertinent to the caſe of their children. Yea can they have ſuch hope without faith, or can they have well-grounded faith where they have not a word of faith for it? and when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve that God ſhould bee ſo much as externally, much leſſe internally and ſavingly a covenant God to them? or can they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that ever any were ſaved ordinarily, if at all, touching whom God never made any promiſe, neither in reſpect of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſaving, no nor ſo much as in reſpect of externall right therein.</p>
                     <p>I conclude then, that ſuch children are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirituall ſeed, and that therefore the promiſes belong to them at leaſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. And ſo much for proofe of this ſeventh concluſion, wherein I have been the longer, in that it is the very hinge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
                     <p>It is not then the Goſpell of any mortall man deriving its riſe from <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> or any ſuch ſinfull ſonne of man, albeit pretious in the ſight of God and his Saints; nor is it any other Goſpel which may bee anathematized, I ſhould feare to bee anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of God if I ſaid ſo. It's Goſpel that beleevers are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. true but that is not all, and onely the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: this part of the Goſpell; their childrens covenant eſtate, at leaſt eccleſiaſtically, this is Goſpell too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8, compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and 30. as before: yea the rather is this Goſpell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the other is: one dependeth and followeth upon the other as hath beene ſhewed.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41963:55"/> by nature bee under two contrary covenants of workes, and of grace. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> alſo hath a like objection.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, they are not under two ſuch contrary eſtates by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, taken in the ſame ſenſe: but by nature taken in a diverſe ſenſe, they may: take nature for corrupt ſinfull nature, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> a Jew and all other Jewes, or Gentiles, [Wee ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>] are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture children of wrath.

And in their confeſſing parents confeſſors and profeſſors, as the word Jew is uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 9. 28. and <hi>Eſt.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 7. they became Jewes, that is, joyned in a Church eſtate, &amp;c. ſinners they were in that ſenſe, they had by ſinfull nature ſinne in them, but ſinners in oppoſition to a Jew, or Church and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant eſtate, at leaſt externally they were not: not Jewes barely, <hi>ſcil.</hi> perſons of that nation, without further Eccleſiaſticall reſpect, to the adminiſtration of the covenant: for then the notion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Gentiles, had been unſuitably added; It had ſufficed to have ſaid, wee that are Jewes by nature, and not Gentiles, but Jewes by nature rather as above; the elect ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> of which yet many died in infancy, they were the choyce children of that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9. yet they were alſo by nature children of wrath. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was viſibly the child of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Infancy borne by promiſe: intereſted in the promiſe, expreſly made with reference to him, as ſoone as borne actually; as before intentionally; yet alſo by nature, as a ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> a child of wrath; but as a ſonne of covenant-<hi>Abraham,</hi> a child of promiſe. The like may be ſaid of <hi>David</hi> in the former ſenſe conceived in ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. in the latter a child of promiſe: So of the other Infants of their loynes, whence injoyned whilſt Infants to bee ſealed with the ſeale of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant. Yea ſome of our oppoſites grant, yea urge it as a reaſon againſt the expoſition of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. which ſome give thereof: that <q rend="inline">children of parents whereof one was not matrimonially ſanctified to the other, but came together unchaſtly, as <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zara,</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Thamar, Jephtah</hi> of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and many others, were within the covenant of ſaving grace, and Church priviledges.</q> Now the author intended not this thus; that they came into the covenant of grace, when they were growne, and came actually
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41963:56"/> to beleeve: for then there were no colour of argument againſt Paedobaptiſts reaſoning from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. touching ſuch Infants co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant eſtate: and that annexed, that they were in the covenant of ſaving grace, and Church priviledges, ſheweth that to bee his meaning; ſince all confeſſe that the Jewes children, did whilſt Infants partake of the initiatory Church ſeale of circumciſion, which the author elſewhere counteth their priviledge, ſaying, that <q rend="inline">they had that priviledge to bee reckones in the outward admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, as branches of the Olive by their birth, by vertue of God his appointment, &amp;c.</q> albeit the author I ſuppoſe forgate himſelfe: ſpeaking of branches by nature, ſaith, that it ſeemeth to him to import, not that the Jewes were in the covenant of grace by nature, but that they had this priviledge to bee reckoned in the outward adminiſtration, as branches of the Olive by their birth, &amp;c. when yet even thoſe illegitimately born of Jewes mentioned, are confeſſed to bee in the covenant of ſaving grace, as well as Church priviledges, which as was ſaid, muſt bee ſpoken of them, as Infants borne of ſuch parents, or elſe it is not any argument againſt them, which plead for birth federall holineſſe from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.

                     <p>
                        <label>Anſw.</label> 1. Wee have aſwell brought grounds of theſe concluſions touching <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. from the new Teſtament. Secondly, Chriſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41963:58"/> came not to evacuate the morall Law in the old Teſtament, no not in a title of it, but to fulfill it, and by expounding it in the very ſpirit of it to eſtabliſh it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. to the end; and the Law it ſelfe is eſtabliſhed through faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. and it's ſpirituall, not carnall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. and what then is the Goſpel of which this point in queſtion is part as was ſhewed, or would Chriſt make void a title of the Goſpel in the old Teſtament, as if in, and of it ſelfe not valid unleſſe come over againe in the new? of what force then would many pretious promiſes bee, in the old Teſtament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but never againe expreſſed in the new, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and ſuch like?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if ſuch proofes are not valid, why keepe wee a weekely Sabbath, as the Lords day is called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20? why keepe wee ſolemne thankſgiving dayes, &amp;c? why doe the Apoſtles referre us for proofe even of the new covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, &amp;c. to what God ſaith, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in the old Teſtament, as in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. or why doth Chriſt fetch his uſuall proofes of the maine matters of faith thence, <hi>John</hi> 5. 46, 47. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44, 45, 46? ſee more in ſuch way of proofes, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. and 28. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. and 10. 14. and 16. 16. beſides many other like which the Apoſtles urge this way.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if ſuch proofes bee invalid, wee muſt blot out ſuch charges and teſtimonies touching their perfection and validitie, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. ſpoken before the new Teſtament was, and yet ſo perfect was it, and ſo efficacious, and pretious: ſo <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. 46, 47. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 6, 7, 8. and <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. 31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16. <hi>Paul</hi> makes account the Scriptures, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of the old Teſtament little elſe being then written, were of ſufficiencie to all uſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a Miniſter ſtood in need to make of the word, as <hi>Cartwright</hi> on the place expounds it, and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. 19, 20, 21. ſpeaking of Scripture by men inſpired of old, thoſe of the old Teſtament: <hi>Peter</hi> maketh them more valid then extraordinary voyces from heaven, touching Chriſt, &amp;c. and chargeth them to be in perpetuall requeſt with the Saints, ſee <hi>Ames</hi> and others <hi>in locum.</hi> If <hi>Hen.

And the Law and the Prophets
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41963:59"/> teach is to repent [for] remiſſion, but the Goſpel, repent [unto] remiſſion, &amp;c. to let paſſe his abuſe of the teſtimonies he alludeth to, this I obſerve that Prophets, with him, of the old Teſtament are ſet in oppoſition to Goſpell as if inconſiſtent with it, the abſurditie of which is apparent enough in the very naming it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, if they bee invalid unleſſe come over in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then muſt all the Saints queſtion their faith and comfort which was occaſioned more immediatly from grounds in the old Teſtament, not eying at that preſent, nor poſſibly afterwards, this or that like paſſage in the new, touching the diſcovery of their good eſtate, or otherwiſe of their ſpirituall ſupport, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. which Scriptures then mentioned, were of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, if ſo, how did <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and the Apoſtles convince the Jewes, before yet the new Teſtament was exiſting of ſuch, and ſuch things touching their peace, and touching Chriſts kingdome, and government, yea, what ordinary meanes is left to convince the Jewes, when they are to come in, they denying the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament to bee valid? ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 26.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, the primitive converts and diſciples thought not ſo, touching ſuch was of old teſtament Scripture proofe, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. by Scriptures, meaning thoſe of the old Taſtament, as thoſe places, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. and 10. 35. and 7. 38. and 2. 22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. 22. and 4. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 17. and 10, 11. and 11. 2. and here let mee not forget what <hi>A. R.</hi> in his ſecond part of Vanitie of childiſh baptiſme, bringeth croſſe to what wee have ſaid, hee ſaith that no beleevers are fathers, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in ſuch covenant and Church reſpects to their children which wee have mentioned, but <hi>Abraham</hi> onely; and hee maketh <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> rather a patterne father in other reſpects to beleevers quoting Scriptures to that end.</p>
                     <p>But doth <hi>A. R.</hi> indeed thinke that no others were covenant and Church-fathers but <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, the Apoſtle calleth all thoſe inchurched Jewes of old our fathers, fathers to him and to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Corinthian members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, &amp;c. Yea will hee ſay that <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. were not ſuch fathers to their ſeed alſo as was <hi>Abraham</hi> in covenant, and Church reſpects, becauſe that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid to <hi>Iſaac</hi> or to <hi>Jacob,</hi> I have made thee a father of nations? how then are the Jewes ſaid to be beloved for their [fathers] ſakes? ſurely it was not for their ſakes as men, and naturall fathers, but as ſpirituall and covenant fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. 28. compared, of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41963:59"/> which more hereafter; yea the covenant is expreſly made in thoſe termes to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to his ſeed; to <hi>Jacob;</hi> and to his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 3, 4, 5. and 28. 13. 14. In reſpect therefore to their ſeed they are covenant fathers, yet in reſpect to <hi>Abraham,</hi> they themſelves were <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant and Church ſeed, to whom together with their father the covenant was made, even with a Church reference <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and ſo are gentiles inchurched beleevers: fathers, as ſuch, to their children; yet ſeed alſo in reference to <hi>Abraham:</hi> nor is it more contradiction to ſay thus, that the ſame perſons may bee <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and yet fathers in divers reſpects, then to ſay the ſame man may bee a ſonne, and yet a father in divers reſpects, a ſonne in reſpect of his father, and a father in relation to his child. Nor can I perceive otherwiſe but that <hi>A. R.</hi> himſelfe, layeth in the ſame place a groundworke croſſe to his owne aſſertion this way: <q rend="inline">the covenant (ſaith he) was not made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and with his ſeed, meerely for his being a faithfull man, but for his being ſuch a faithfull man whom the Lord pleaſed to chooſe to make a patterne to all beleevers;</q> hence to me it ſeemeth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is conſidered in a threefold reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as a faithfull man having ſeed. Secondly, as a faithfull man having the covenant made with him, and his ſeed. Thirdly, as one, with whom and with his ſeed the covenant is made, not meerely as a faithfull man, but as a patterne to all beleevers, which to me undeniably ſeemeth to bee an unwilling grant that as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in covenant with him admit a diſtinct conſideration from all actuall beleevers, as ſuch, whether Jewes or Gentiles: So that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in that conſideration of ſuch a faithfull man, with whom the covenant was made, and with his ſeed ſo diſtinguiſhed from all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, whether of Jewes or Gentiles, was therein a patterne to all beleevers actually, whether of Jews or Gentiles, yea that he was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch ſort a patterne to them all, and had the covenant ſo made with him, and with that his ſeed, that hee might bee, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſhould bee, therein a patterne to all beleevers whether Jewes or Gentiles: and this is the very truth, which wee affirme, that <hi>Abraham</hi> in the eſſentialls of the covenant, was a patterne of intereſt of beleevers and their children in the covenant of grace, at leaſt externally, and eccleſiaſtically: but this is croſſe to <hi>A. R.</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, yea in the ſame place as followeth.</p>

But to come to <hi>A.

R</hi>'s. ground, they muſt needs be all &amp; each of them ſaved, it is not poſſible there ſhould bee any reprobates and hypocrites in a particular viſible Church, which to affirme is ridiculous, but let him quit himſelfe thereof from his owne principle if hee can: the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Galatian</hi> Churches, and members thereof to whom hee wrote, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1, 2. that they were children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and of the free woman, and that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above was the mother of him, and them [all] <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. 28. 31. and that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. now then I demand whether wee muſt not conclude of them all that they were in a ſure eſtate, and infallibly ſaved, according to <hi>A. R</hi>'s. ground, comparing <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16, 17. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. Yea but why then doth <hi>Paul</hi> feare and queſtion ſo much the eſtate of perſons, ſo ſure and infallible, if ſo it were, becauſe called all <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: for hee feareth leſt hee had beſtowed his labour in vaine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 11. and that any ſaving worke, in many of them at leaſt, was not ſo much as yet begun, that hee muſt bee faine to travaile againe with them in birth, till Chriſt bee formed in them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. yea why doth he ſuppoſe any poſſibilitie of their ſuffering in vaine, of their ending in the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. of Chriſts becomming of none effect to them, Chap. 5. 4. many of them being of ſuch ſpirits and way whom he there intended, as appeares by <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8. and 3. 1. and 23. 4, 5. and 4. 21? How will <hi>A. R.</hi> ſalve it? not by ſaying hee ſpake thus in a collective ſenſe onely, underſtanding the former, of the elect part, and the latter of others. Yea but why then doth hee mention their being baptized into ſuch an eſtate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28, 29?
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41963:60"/> were none but true beleevers and elect ones in that Church bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? for all that were baptized are ſaid to bee one in Chriſt as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put on Chriſt, and if Chriſt, then <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: either then there were none but elect ones &amp; true beleevers in thoſe Churches, which were abſurd, and croſſe to the Scriptures before named, or if there were any hypocrites or reprobates in that Church, they were left unbaptized, which were as abſurd, to avow it; for how knew they ſo exactly to diſtinguiſh of ſuch divine ſecrets, in ſo infallible a way? were they Gods to know the ſecret guile of hearts? Now if not unbaptized, then they alſo in baptiſme putting on Chriſt, and putting on Chriſt, being one with Chriſt, and ſo Chriſts, and being Chriſts were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; now <hi>A.

Secondly, a kingdome which ſuch actuall ſubjects of that kingdome doe receive. Thirdly, a kingdome unto which in an ordinary way and meanes they come to enter. The firſt is meant of the viſible, not of the inviſible Church, and of them as members of the former, and not ſo properly of the latter; touching which, let it bee remembred that this was not a bare temporary, and preſent charge, in reference barely to thoſe very children, and onely to that very preſent approach to Chriſt, but did reſpect after approches of ſuch like perſons unto Chriſt, hee ſaith not, ſuffer theſe little children to come (at this time) to mee, for of theſe is the Kingdome of God, but indefinitely, rather ſuffer little ones, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of this ſort, ſuch as theſe are to come to mee: nor would <hi>A.

Now as for the members of the inviſible Church, as ſuch they are inviſible, and fall not under the proper cognizance of the ſons of men to know, which or where they are: and to ſuppoſe an injunction of not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring their approach to Chriſt, unleſſe they came under a viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of members of the viſible Church that they might bee diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and it might bee knowne how and when, and in whom this rule of ſuffering ſuch to come to Chriſt, were kept or broken, it were very incongruous, and it's a very improbable conjecture, that Chriſt ſpake thus of theſe very Infants, by an act of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them to bee the elect of God: as if a company of children

                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11, 12. were ſurely in that kingdome toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of which they came to bee caſt afterwards; the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed man child was of the people or Church of God in viſible account, elſe not cut off from his people in that caſe of neglect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. and in the purer dayes of the Goſpell, yet expected, the children are put under <hi>David</hi> or Chriſt their Prince as King, and head, and Lord of his viſible Church, as well as the parents, as before wee ſhewed from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25, 26, 27. and God accounted them even in very corrupt time, children of his covenant ſpouſe or viſible Church, Thy children which thou bareſt to mee, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. 8. 20, 21. 23. witneſſe the ſetting to of the initiatory Church ſeale of circumciſion to thoſe children of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> loynes; and no wonder, in that they were all intereſted in the covenant of grace, as inveſted with Church-covenant, which is even the very forme of the Church, giving Church being to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therein intereſted; nor is it likely that theſe children were other then ſuch, being either proſelytes children, joyned to the Jewiſh Church, or children of Jewes, either of them formerly circumciſed, and <hi>in facie eccleſiae</hi> of the Church, the Apoſtles which uſed to bee queſtioning any thing obſcure, which they underſtood not, or ſeemed to them ſtrange, would in likelihood have inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after ſatisfaction therein, of Chriſt, as their manner was, if it had not been very cleare, convincing, approved, received do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which Chriſt urged as his reaſon of reproofe of their act in hindring the little ones approach to him; hee which himſelfe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41963:62"/> forbad them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. to goe into the way of the Gentiles, no not into <hi>Samaria,</hi> and when himſelfe tooke up the Gentile <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite</hi> in ſuch ſort at firſt, albeit ſhe a beleever, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 22. if theſe had beene other then viſible beleeving inchurched perſons, yea though Gentiles yet inchurched proſelytes which brought theſe children, hee would not have ſo roundly, and ſharpely taken up his Diſciples, for aſſaying to hinder them from him, when the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. ſpeaketh thus to the Church, and not to the citie as ſuch, which writ to him, and to whom hee writ this back againe; hee ſaith elſe [their] children, as appropriating externall adoption, as well as formerly, to others of that ſort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3, 4. they were the children of that Spouſe of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. 3. as thoſe were formerly of that Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20, 21. ſhe brought forth other children by the miniſtry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 5. albeit, not ſo many as now, and hereafter, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54. 5. but that way alſo did the Church beare children to the Lord. And are purer Gentiles Churches wombes in that reſpect ſhut up; or doth the Lord leſſe affect communion with his Church in that expreſſion of his love now, then hee did to the Church of old? ſurely no; the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> members as a Church body, had their Church children, and ſeed: alſo, the Apoſtle taketh order with the women, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Let [your] women keepe ſilence in the Churches; but why [your]? what, becauſe they were the members wives onely? no verily: ſince ſome ſuch were Pagans, and without the Church, and hee proteſteth againſt any Church dealing with ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. end; what have wee to doe with them from any Church care, or reſpect? but rather [your] women as being of the Church, and ſo here, not [your] children holy: <hi>ſcil.</hi> barely of your members in a common naturall way: but yours in a Church relation rather. And let the Apoſtles diviſion bee further attended, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. placing all perſons as either within or without the viſible Church: For if his diviſion be regular, as who will ſay otherwiſe, of the wiſeſt dictates of the holy Ghoſt? then theſe <hi>membra dividentia</hi> take up the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and there is no middle or neutrall eſtate actually of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And albeit the perſons chiefly intended, bee adult perſons, yet it muſt hold, as well of others, or elſe it is not a compleat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. So then the little ones which are borne of inchurched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they are either actually within the Church, or actually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out at preſent, onely ſome poſſibilities as ſome ſuppoſe of their being actuall members, afterward at moſt: but at preſent their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41963:62"/> eſtate muſt bee the one, or the other; if actually within the Church, I have what I ſeeke, if onely potentially ſuch as may come in, but yet actually without, 1. then the children of the Church in primitive times were ſuch as the Apoſtles, as extraordinary, and now Elders as ordinary officers in the Church, were not, nor are to take any ſpeciall Church care of; ſince the tie of that Church care, as ſuch, dependeth upon covenant and Church relation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinary, as that of the Apoſtles, to all the Churches; or ordinary, as that of the officers of this or that Church. 2. Then Churches and their officers are not to deale with any ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more then with pagans in any Church way of inſtruction or admonition when growne up. 3. Then are ſuch ſo farre forth to bee left as perſons without actually, to the more immediate judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; what have wee to doe with ſuch? God judgeth them, and the phraſe of Gods judging them, how ſad a caſe it noteth, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4. and 10. 29, 30, 31. 4. Then ſuch children being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally without, they are actually and at preſent amongſt the number of ſuch perſons of whom is little hope: as <hi>Marke</hi> 4. 11, 12. to them without: if hardned perſons, in parables: ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. without are dogs. The perſons left out of Church fellowſhip by the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are of the worſt ſort, <hi>

                     <p>ANd thus farre of the diſpenſing kingdome of God, as it ſeemes to bee included, and intended in the firſt expreſſion, Of ſuch is the kingdome of God: which may ſerve to anſwer the ſcruples of ſome, as if ſuch an aſſertion of children of beleevers, to bee of Gods kingdome, ſhould croſſe the courſe of providence, many proving wicked: For this hinders not, but they belong to the viſible Church: no more then Chriſts aſſertion of all the Jewes, to be the children of the kingdome of heaven, into which the Gentiles from all parts ſhould come after the rejection of the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11, 12. nor is this any more croſſe to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. then that is; yea ſuppoſe the Kingdome of heaven bee taken for that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41963:63"/> of glory; yet in that covenant and Church eſtate is theirs, ſo far alſo is glory theirs, <hi>ſcil. in foro eccleſiae.</hi> And wee have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Chriſt ſpake this as man, not meerely as God, as hee ſaid before of the Jewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11, 12. and after this ſpake to like purpoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43. they were as externally adopted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. externally inrighted to that promiſe of glory, the promiſes indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely being thus far theirs, &amp; that promiſed heritage being thus far theirs. If they had not Gods kingdome, in reſpect of this eſtating of theirs in it, and right to it; how came they to have it taken from them? was not that in reſpect of any externall Church right actually theirs unto, or to the diſpenſation of the covenant hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame forth? they were all heires, albeit under tutors, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. but to mee the former ſenſe is rather moſt unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that of ſuch is the kingdome of God, or of heaven, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the viſible Church as before was proved; and this may alſo ſatisfie that which is objected, that hee might ſpeake this in reference to the future; that is, that they were elect ones, and ſhould in time bee of Gods kingdome, that is, beleevers, or in that they were ſuch as God would bleſſe: For Chriſts words are not, Of ſuch may, will or ſhall bee the kingdome of God, nor that they were of his kingdome, becauſe ſuch as hee would bleſſe; but rather that they ſhould not bee hindred from being bleſſed of him, becauſe of ſuch [is] the kingdome of God; as the context and force of that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in reference to the occaſion ſheweth: and as for that aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their being all elect, the improbabilitie thereof hath before appeared; nor doth Chriſt ſeeme to ſpeal: of the kingdome of God as taken for the inviſible Church of actuall beleevers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of viſible members of the viſible Church, as before was ſhewed. Hee affirmeth that thoſe little ones, <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> were of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, yet were not they actually beleevers, hee aſſerteth as much of the Jews to be rejected afterward, that yet at preſent they were the children of that very kingdome of heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the Gentiles, even the very beſt of them come to ſit; the Church eſtate in both was the ſame in the eſſentialls, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant eſtate the ſame eſſentially: the externall right to grace, and glory the very ſame eſſentially, and ſo the reaſon of the grant here, and aſſertion, is the ſame in reference to the little ones, of other viſible beleevers, as of theſe which brought their children to Chriſt, unleſſe God ſhould bee made a reſpecter of perſons; their Infants muſt come to Chriſt, and not bee hindred, becauſe they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41963:63"/> were Federally and Eccleſiaſtically priviledged, or becauſe of ſuch is Gods kingdome; the ſame is valid now, ſince as adult perſons externally in covenant and Church eſtate, muſt not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our oppoſites mindes bee hindred from Chriſt, becauſe ſuch like as theſe little ones; ſo neither beleevers little ones being alſo ſuch like as well; they may not bee hindred from any ſuch way of initiatory approach to Chriſt as they are capable of, as is externall baptizing in the name or fellowſhip, as of the Father, ſo of Chriſt the Sonne, and alſo of the holy Spirit; to which purpoſe I ſuppoſe our Divines had reference, in urging this place for Paedobaptiſme, nor was this an affirming of Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved by their parents faith, but an aſſenting of their externall Church right, by vertue of the latitude of Gods covenant apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the parents, and by occaſion of their holding forth of that faith, which did, <hi>foro eccleſiae,</hi> unite them, and their little ones to Chriſt, as head of the viſible Church, in which may by externall adoption and inſition are intereſted, which are not ſaved as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſhewed; nor will that take off what it ſeemeth, ſome worthy Divines, have lately urged from hence for Paedobaptiſme; that if Chriſts mind had beene that Infants ſhould have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, hee would have commanded theſe little ones to have beene baptized for an example: for according to the principles of <hi>C. B.</hi> and others, Chriſt did love theſe little ones with his everlaſting love, they received heaven of free gift, as all that will bee ſaved muſt doe: theirs was the kingdome of glory really, and Chriſt as God, and as an extraordinary Prophet of the Church knew all this, &amp;c. now why ſhould not, or were not theſe Infants, at leaſt baptized? <hi>C. B.</hi> will anſwer, Infants of beleevers may die in their Infancy, and they may live to commit actuall ſinnes, &amp;c. and wee not knowing which will live or die, cannot baptize them, what then according to <hi>C. B.</hi> it ſeemes the uncertainty of Infants deaths, whilſt young, or living to growne yeares, is an impediment to their baptiſme. Where did <hi>C. B.</hi> here or ever read in Scripture or of ſuch a juſt barre to Infants baptiſme? but ſuppoſe it were ſo to us, which know not this, yet <hi>C. B.</hi> will not ſay but Chriſt knew all herein, how matters would prove, therefore that was no juſt hinderance in the nature of it thereto; for then hee to whom this could bee no hinderance touching theſe children about whom <hi>C. B.</hi> ſaith hee revealed his Fathers eternall live, and good will, hee had cauſed at leaſt theſe little ones to have been baptized. Yea I demand upon the grant of thoſe things mentioned, whether <hi>C. B.</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41963:64"/> or others oppoſing Paedobaptiſme, would deny that ſuch as Chriſt receiveth, and bleſſeth, and alloweth, the kingdome of heaven in their ſenſe, that is, that of glory, to be theirs, if growne ones, ſhould not therefore bee baptized. Now if this will not be denied, as I ſuppoſe, why, ſuppoſing the like caſe of any little ones, and Infants, ſhall the ſame bee denyed where there is the ſame ground of baptiſme in both ſorts? Nay ſuppoſe that by extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, <hi>C. B.</hi> and others of his minde did know as much as here is mentioned, in <hi>Marke</hi> 10. and <hi>Luke</hi> 16. that ſuch and ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were Gods choſen ones, that they were received, and bleſſed of Chriſt, not in any common way, but as the very heires of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as theſe Infants are by them ſuppoſed to bee, and ſo were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bleſſed with the ſpirit of grace, &amp;c. would not they baptize theſe Infants? I ſuppoſe the more judicious would, and have ſaid that, in that caſe, they would doe it, becauſe <q rend="inline">ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary revelation would ſuffice to warrant the act of baptizing ſuch Infants without profeſſion of faith, and becauſe of <hi>Peters</hi> principle, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47. Can any forbid that theſe ſhould bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as wee? and the inſtitution of baptizing Diſciples, would in this caſe beare it out, ſuch ſanctified perſons being Diſciples, &amp;c.</q> Nor indeed could it bee denyed by them rationally; ſince in this caſe Infants are not meerely ſuppoſed to bee capable thereof, but really to have received the ſublime things viſibly ſealed in baptiſme, even the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, love, and bleſſing of Chriſt, the promiſe of grace and glory, &amp;c. And therefore not to bee denied baptiſme, eſpecially ſeeing this their receiving of the thing ſignified, is alſo manifeſted, &amp; ſo all uſuall occaſions that way removed. Now then to come to apply what here is granted; Firſt, then perſons may come under the notion of Diſciples which were never outwardly taught, and cannot perſonally hold out actuall faith, which our oppoſites elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where deny. Secondly, that it is not contrary to Chriſts minde, and to the rule, that perſons, without perſonall profeſſion of faith ſhould bee baptized. For as the former notion of Diſciples, if <hi>natura rei,</hi> it were not otherwiſe applyable, then as not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo neither extraordinarily: and whether ordinarily, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, if applyable ſo; it is not ſimply to bee denyed; ſo I ſay in the latter: albeit, extraordinary things done beſides rule croſſe not ordinary rule; yet neither extraordinarily nor ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is any thing to be done, which is in it ſelf contrary to rule. It was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41963:64"/> beſide rule for a Prieſt to kill <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> but not a breach of rule, or any thing contrary to rule. Thirdly, that there was ground why Chriſt might command thoſe little ones brought to him to bee baptized, yea it was his mind, and according to his will they ſhould bee baptized, albeit it bee not mentioned that they were baptized: who could forbid water that they ſhould bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, which received the holy Ghoſt, which were Diſciples? Chriſts extraordinary knowledge of it himſelfe, and revelation thereof to his Apoſtles then preſent, which uſed to baptize others, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. 2. it's granted was ſufficient warrant, albeit there had been no rule for it, when yet in this caſe the rule of baptizing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. alſo might ſuffice. Let it then bee no more ſaid, that if it had been Chriſts mind, that Infants ſhould bee baptized, hee would have commanded thoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. to bee baptized, ſince according to the acknowledged principles, thoſe little ones either were, or might groundedly have been baptized. But wee will ſuppoſe Chriſt did not then expreſly injoyne thoſe little ones bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or that they were not then baptized, yet will it not follow that it was not his mind ſuch babes to whom hee expreſſed ſuch love ſhould not bee baptized, or were not baptized; hee that had his time of bleſſing them, was free to take his time of injoyning their baptiſme. Yea hee gave not any expreſſe charge, touching any care to bee had of them, by thoſe which brought them: nor touching their being further inſtructed, in the way of God, and many other things of that nature: And yet none will thence rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was not his minde, that any ſpeciall care or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious indeavour, touching their further good ſhould bee uſed. No more doth the former follow that it was not his mind that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe or any other ſuch like perſons ſhould bee baptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee did not then expreſſe his mind that way touching thoſe little ones. There might bee diverſe other reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why Chriſt might not then injoyne the ſame: poſſibly their parents themſelves, albeit circumciſed, yet not baptized, or if baptized, their children alſo might be baptized when they were. And his reaſons to prove that by kingdome of heaven is rather meant that of glory then of grace, are as weake ſtill. Firſt, Becauſe they underſtand not the Lawes of the kingdome of grace. Secondly, becauſe this kingdome is a locall kingdome, as appeareth by the word entring in. But doth <hi>C. B.</hi> which ſaith theſe Infants did receive the kingdome of God by gift, thinke that they received not the kingdome of grace,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41963:65"/> at preſent before their entrance into glory, they were not yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred heaven, but on earth then, and long after it may bee, yet hee ſaith thoſe little ones received it of gift; in what way, or by what meanes could they receive it? without any covenant right? ſurely no: For there is no inheritance of glory other then that promiſed inheritance, hence the promiſe put for glory promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36. nor eternall life, but ſuch as is promiſed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. yea could they receive it, without the Spirit? which yet they muſt alſo partake of by promiſe, or no way: none are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine nature in any reſpect but by the promiſes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. now if thus really, and effectually intereſted in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and partakers of the ſpirit, then the kingdome of grace too was theirs: albeit they underſtood not the Lawes of it. Yea doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinke that the kingdome of glory belongs to any to whom that of grace belongeth not? muſt not that bee firſt ours before the other? yea doth not the phraſe of receiving the kingdome note out, that the kingdome of glory is received, in and by the receiving of that of grace, or of the word of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the promiſe, and covenant, &amp;c. elſe is it not improper to ſay that thoſe Infants before they entred into Gods kingdome of glory they did receive it? It's a Locall kingdome, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath it, and is it proper to ſay that a man receiveth a place, before hee come at it, otherwiſe then by word of mouth, or writing, or ſome equivalent ingagement? I conclude then that the kingdome that they received was rather that of grace, even the covenant of grace, if not alſo grace of the covenant, wherein was plighted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged ſome right to that of glory, or that it was the kingdome of glory, in reference to ſuch plighting and pledge of it. Nor doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> his other reaſon conclude againſt what I have ſaid, they were at leaſt externally of Gods kingdome, in that firſt ſenſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> conſidered, as his kingdome diſpenſing, <hi>ſcil.</hi> his Church. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they received his kingdome in a ſecond ſenſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> conſidered as diſpenſed in the revealed way of Gods plighting of it by word, and initiatory ſeale at laſt of Circumciſion, if not of Baptiſme; and how ever in the externall right to both they are ſuch, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to men at leaſt ſhould enter into glory in reſpect of actuall fruition of it, which is the kingdome in a third ſenſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the kingdome to bee poſſeſſed, and to which a entring in, in the Text hath indeed reference; but elſe Mr. <hi>Blackwoods</hi> reaſon would not inforce it, that becauſe of that locall expreſſion of entring in; the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41963:65"/> kingdome muſt <hi>ergo</hi> bee a locall kingdome, or heaven it ſelfe: there are locall expreſſions very full, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11, 12. ſitting down of ſome in the kingdome of heaven, out of which others are caſt: yet will not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> conclude that even the Jewes were in heaven, and ſo caſt out thence, if they had not been firſt in, they had not been thence caſt: in, and out, are here relatives. It was ſome other kingdome, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that of grace in the externall ſubject of it, the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church; and ingagement of it, the covenant of grace and diſpenſation of it: the adminiſtration of Church ordinances, &amp;c. in which they were by externall adoption and inciſion, and out of all actuall priviledges whereof they were afterward caſt. As for that which others object againſt us in this point of childrens fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall and eccleſiaſticall eſtate from hence, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that Chriſt ſaith not of theſe, but of ſuch, and ſuch like, <hi>ſcil.</hi> as <hi>A. R.</hi> hath it, ſuch like in humilitie, &amp;c. is the kingdome of God, &amp;c. this is as groundleſſe an interpretation as ſome others mentioned.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, it's evident that Chriſt maketh theſe little ones patterns to others like them, in that intereſt in Gods kingdome, of ſuch or ſuch like is Gods kingdome; now ſamples muſt have that verified in themſelves, in ſome ſenſe in which they are examples to others; ſecondly, they are incluſively made examples of ſuch an initiatory receiving of the kingdome of heaven, as tendeth to a more full fruition, and injoyment thereof, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 15. and and therefore at leaſt externally ſuch, and ſo qualified themſelves now will their paralelling this with, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4, 5, 6. hold good therein, to ſay nothing, that that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 6. may bee read from the Greek, theſe little ones <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, of perſons beleeving or of beleevers in mee, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of parents beleeving in Chriſt, which little ones are not to be ſlighted but received in Chriſts name, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>ſcil.</hi> unto Church communion as well as others, as that phraſe implyeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 7. This is undeniable that the occaſion of that ſpeech in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and of this in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Marke</hi> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. was different, and at divers times uttered as the Texts compared ſhew, nor ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. as here, hee that receiveth not the kingdome of God as a little child, but thus; unleſſe yee bee as children, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in humilitie, &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. compared; and that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. doth not conclude, <hi>ergo</hi> the intereſt of ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, more then unto Doves, or ſheepe unto whom ſubjects of Gods kingdome are like, but here as hee ſaith of ſuch like is Gods kingdome: for withall, hee ſaith that others muſt receive Gods
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41963:66"/> kingdome as they doe, making them patternes as well of receiving of, as intereſt in Gods kingdome, which was never affirmed of ſheepe or doves are harmeleſſe, if patternes of it. Actuall guile, malice and envie are removed from Infants, they act not ſuch ſinnes if they are patternes to others therein, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, they are low and little in their owne eyes, not minding great things, &amp;c. if patternes of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. 1, 2. ſo here they are intereſted in Gods kingdome, doe receive it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally at leaſt, both thoſe here mentioned, and ſuch like Infants, if they were made patternes thereof unto others, elſe the ſenſe of <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. would bee thus, Unleſſe any receive Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as a child doth, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in a bare reſemblance of reception thereof without any realitie therein, ſo much as ſuppoſed, he ſhall not enter into it. Thirdly, Chriſt bringeth this as a reaſon why his Diſciples ſhould not hinder little ones as prophane from him, but rather further the approach of thoſe babes, becauſe of ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Infants, like them in covenant, and Church intereſt in God his kingdome. Now if this had beene Chriſts onely reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as is imagined, becauſe not of theſe out of ſuch like little ones by reſemblance in humilitie, and harmeleſneſſe, &amp;c. is Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, therefore further, and doe not hinder their comming to mee; then one might upon the ſame ground argue, that ſince oft perſons like good ſeed, and good fiſh for uſefulneſſe and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. is Gods kingdome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. 38. 47. 49. and ſince of perſons like Eagles for renovation, ſight, and ſeed, &amp;c. Gods kingdome doth conſiſt, therefore further, and doe not hinder the bringing of ſuch ſeed, fiſh, and Eagles unto Chriſt; this were ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. Yea ſuppoſe any other thing ſhort of what I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned touching theſe babes, wherein ſome of theſe creatures are not all out fully reſembling the Saints, yet if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted more then thoſe creatures in the kingdome mentioned, it's not the degrees of more or leſſe like which will alter the force of that formall reaſon of not hindering theſe creatures therefore from Chriſt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> becauſe bare reſemblances of the Saints, as our oppoſites interpret this. Fourthly, as Chriſt taking them up in his armes, as the word is tranſlated, ſheweth they were little ones indeed, of whom hee ſpake, and not metaphoricall little ones, even growne perſons like them; ſo other acts ſhew that hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as much in effect touching thoſe babes in his acts about them, as in his words hee ſpake touching them, the expreſſions of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41963:66"/> Chriſts love toward thoſe perſons, whether he tooke them up in his armes or imbraced them, it was no complement in Chriſt, but a moſt ſignificant expreſſion of his love; &amp; his bleſſing of them, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they had ſome more peculiar intereſt in ſome reſpects, at leaſt in an Eccleſiaſticall and Federall way, in him the King, and in that his kingdome mentioned, then to be bare ſemblances of others which had.

                     <p>Secondly, that ſort of growne gentiles being ſuppoſed onely to bee made nigh by the blood of Chriſt in covenant, and Church reſpects actually: it will argue that that ſort onely were actually ſtrangers before, &amp; not their children with them, not only individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but ſpecifically conſidered, ſince the ſame ſorts at leaſt of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, formerly ſtrangers, are made nigh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 21. 11, 22, 13. compared.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, then is it ſuppoſed that Chriſt tooke downe the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wall which ſtood betweene growne Jewes and adult Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but as for the beleeving Gentiles Infants, either there was no ſuch partition wall betwixt them and their parallels the Jewiſh Infants inchurched, or if there were, it ſo farre remaines untaken downe as concerning that ſort of Infants.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, then Divine juſtice is ſuppoſed to have a larger latitude in involving the little ones of ſuch as reſpect the Covenant under the expreſſions and viſible diſpenſations of divine diſpleaſure, as in <hi>Caines, Iſhmaels, Eſau's,</hi> the Jewes rejection together with their little ones; then divine grace hath in the expreſſions and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations thereof, unto the little ones of ſuch as tooke hold thereof; contrary to all former examples: how long did God continue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall adoption, and ſon-ſhip in <hi>Seths</hi> line, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 1. how long in <hi>Abrahams, Iſaacs</hi> and <hi>Jacobs, Rom.</hi> 9. 4. and not rejecting them till rebelling univerſally, and fatally?</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, then it's ſuppoſed, that there are two covenants of grace, one with them of old, another with us now, eſſentially different, which is abſurd as before was ſhewed, and may bee further evinced in that baptiſme, that new way of initiatory ſealing of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when firſt inſtituted, it was inſtituted preciſely with ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 1. 33. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 5, 6. to ſhew that there was no other cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be ſealed by baptiſme, then that which was made with the Jewes in the ſubſtance of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44, 45, 46, 47. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. the ſame promiſe firſt ſealed by baptiſme to them before was to them
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41963:69"/> afarre off, and no other to them afarre off to bee ſealed by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme then that promiſe which was to them, and to their children; now if one covenant eſſentially, then either the Jewes children were not in covenant, no not ſo much as externally; contrary to what wee ſhewed before from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and in the concluſions laid downe: or if they were, it was meerely ceremonious; now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ceremony in the way of ſealing, by circumciſing of the fleſh of their foreskin; yet what ceremony was in the principall part of the covenant it ſelfe, I will bee a God to thee and to thy ſeed after thee in their generations? or if it were one part of the covenant, then, but is now aboliſhed by Chriſt, then it ſeemes Chriſt by his comming hath aboliſhed one materiall part of the covenant of grace, without any other thing equivalent to parents as covenant parents in ſtead thereof.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, then God is made a reſpector of perſons looking at Jewes with theirs in covenant reſpects, but not ſo eying covenant inchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Gentiles: Yea hee is made to ſpeake things at large, to bee a God to all the families of the earth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 1. yet when it commeth to bee Analyſed, he is not a covenant God to any more then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons actually beleeving onely: no covenant reſpect is had ſo much as externally, no not ſo much as to the choyceſt part and prop of the families, <hi>ſcil.</hi> children.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, then is all former diſtinction, ever uſed to bee ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved, and held forth, and mentioned, laid aſide. Seed of the woman, and of the Serpent in the younglings of both are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, no diſtinction of ſonnes of God, and of men, of ſeed of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in the Infant part thereof. No Church diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of children cleane or incleane; Albeit, that wee mentioned not to the State, but Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as a Church to whom the contrary was noted as abſurd; elſe even the children were as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans uncleane, but now they are holy. So <hi>Acts</hi> 2. To you, and your children, not to others; as afterwards: actually to others with theirs Some onely were nigh in covenant, and politicall Church reſpects; the reſt farre off: nay doe not <hi>C. B. Hen. Den,</hi> and ſome others ground upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. whereby to put beleevers children in the ſame eſtate without any difference, as ſuch, from any others children? Nay <hi>C. B.</hi> would know why Turkes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers Infants being alike free from actuall ſinne and guilt of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, that they may not partake of the ſame benefit of free grace, and albeit in them there bee ſomething worthy of damnation, yet
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41963:70"/> it appeares not from Scripture that any were damned for originall ſinne onely, and would know why wee ſhould not thinke as much of Infants in generall, dying infants, as was ſaid of <hi>Davids</hi> child, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23. thought by Divines to bee ſaved, bringing <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. for a proofe of ſuch generall redemption of dying Infants. Strange charitie beyond all bounds of regular judgement, to all Infants dying, and none to beleevers Infants in generall, ſo much as of their externall intereſt in the covenant; but doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> expound deaths reigne over Infants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. to bee onely reſtrained to that of the firſt death? or might <hi>Babylons</hi> little ones bee accurſed if not under wrath, as ſuch? doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> imagine that all the Infants deſtroyed in the flood, in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> in the laſt deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. that it is ſo much as probable they that were ſaved? are all by nature the children of wrath, and yet all dying in that eſtate, and under no covenant of grace, ſo much as exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it is, ſo much as probable that all ſuch are ſaved? Is there any Mediation of Chriſt, but as a Mediator of a covenant? and are Turkes Infants under the covenant, when as their parents are not? were all Gentiles of old, yong and old, being ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe and of the Church, without God, and Chriſt, and hope: and now the caſe is ſo altered that the chrildren of ſtrangers from the covenant are to bee judged hopefull? Doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſtartle at 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. that the children of beleevers, yea though dying Infants, yet as beleevers children, they are no more but civilly cleane, and in covenant reſpects as profane, yet are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans children cleane in reſpect of Covenant mercy? for elſe how can they bee ſaved as before wee proved? as for <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have uſed to anſwer Arminians, that [all] is taken for [many] as before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. But here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in the caſe of dying Infants will have it univerſall: and if univerſally true of dying Infants, why not ſo of all living Infants, why not of all men ſimply, where will there bee a reſtraint? If all men ſimply, in one ſort of perſons dying bee underſtood, and not all men that is many: whereas wee are uſed to bee upbraided with the abſurditie of univerſall redemption; I feare Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s doctrine rather. And ſo much of the firſt part of this diſcourſe touching the covenant and Church eſtate and right of Church members children.</p>

The initiatory ſeale followeth the covenant, wee ſpeake not of an extraordinary time of the Church, when either it hath no particular expreſſe initiatory ſeale diſtinct from another ſealing ordinance; as before that ſolemne covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God in reference to the Church in <hi>Iſaacs</hi> race, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. with 19. ſo there is ſome peculiar ſtate of the time not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to the ordinary time and way of a viſible politicall Church and its adminiſtrations: as then alſo were family Churches, as that in <hi>Melchiſedecs</hi> and <hi>Jobs</hi> family; which not being ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue, were not ſo immediatly eyed in point of ſolemne inſtitution and Church lawes, as was this of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> race, wherein the viſible Church was to bee continued: ſuch extraordinary caſes and times, are very impertinently urged by ſome to infringe the force of ordinary rules, and principles: they know an extraordinary caſe of eating ſhewbread by ſuch as were not Prieſts, of plucking eares of corne on the Sabbath day, of a private Diſciple's baptizing upon an extraordinary and immediate call, as did <hi>Ananias, Acts</hi> 9. of <hi>Zipporah's</hi> circumciſing, and theſe doe not nullifie and invalidate ordinary rules and principles, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumciſion or baptiſme, or the ſanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>This propoſition then I ſhall lay downe for further proofe: that in ordinary times and caſes, reſpecting the politicall viſible Church, and its adminiſtrations; ſuch little ones as are of parents in ſuch viſible Church eſtate, they have externall right unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned initiatory viſible ſeale, of which they are outwardly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ought not to bee denyed the uſe and benefit thereof; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary times then and not extraordinary are here conſidered: let none object then, children of members of an ordinary politicall viſible Church are here conſidered: let none object an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe of <hi>Johs</hi> or <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi> family; a viſible ſeale enjoyned, not a caſe wherein actually any ſuch ſeale is not injoyned is here alſo conſidered; but either actually injoyned, or at leaſt in view at the preſent making of the covenant with Church reference as in the caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. let none object <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noahs</hi> time and caſes againſt our theſis, externall right in ſuch a Church ſeale is propounded; let none confound this with internall and ſaving right, which is viſible to God and not to meere men; the initiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry viſible ſeale is propounded, not all the ſeales or Church privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; as choyſe of officers, and voting in other Church occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. A male child of eight dayes old might bee circumciſed, but was never intended to bee injoyned perſonall appearance at the ſolemne celebration of the paſſeover, there to goe up, and not to bee carried or to have others appeare in their ſtead, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16, 17. all the males which were to bee at that feaſt were as well to bee at the feaſt of tabernacles, <hi>Ibid.</hi> where ſuch as kept that feaſt were to carry boughes to make Booths or Tabernacles to dwell in, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16, 17. compared with <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 34, 35. 38, 39, 40. which none will ſay was Infants worke. Let none then object, that you may as well plead for Infants comming to the Lords Supper, as in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, and was the corruption of the time, as was croſſing, rebaptizing, &amp;c. in uſe in his time too, and as the Jewes Infants partooke of the paſſeover, the contrary whereof appeares in a word wee ſpake of initiatory ſealing of perſons outwardly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable thereof: otherwiſe albeit the parties have a covenant right unto it in the generall; yet in that caſe of incapability, it's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and their <hi>jus in re:</hi> juſtly ſuſpended from being perſonally eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and this doth not make the ordinary rule and ground of right to the initiatory ſeale to bee invalid: ſuppoſe an adult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Pagan or Turke to joyne to our oppoſite Churches; who make totall immerſion eſſentiall to baptiſme, and that they were
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41963:71"/> baniſhed into <hi>Freezeland</hi> or <hi>Greenland</hi> or ſome ſuch cold countrey: if this perſon bee very weake and ſick, yet deſireth to joyne to them ere hee die, I demand whether hee hath right to baptiſme or no? this will not bee denyed: Yea but is this right to bee elicited? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no, unleſſe they would bee guilty of his death. But why not baptized? becauſe you will ſay it's not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There being no contempt of it, but onely a naturall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall incapacitie thereof; but this croſſeth not that ordinary rule, ground, and way of baptizing. Very true, but then let none object againſt ſuch Infants covenant right to the initiatory ſeale; the caſe of the females of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, which albeit in <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant yet not circumciſed: for when God injoyned cutting away of the ſuperfluous foreskin of the fleſh to bee the ſeale of his covenant, the very nature of the command doth in reaſon, if the notion of males had never beene expreſſed, reach the caſe of the males, which have ſuch a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous foreskin of their fleſh, and not the females which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and corporally uncapable thereof: as having by nature no ſuch ſuperfluous foreskin, and ſo in that caſe as in ſome others, that law of circumciſion had ſome things peculiar in it, albeit it had other things in common with that of baptiſme.

                     <p>THat conſequentiall commandements grounded on Scripture are Scripture commandements; as even conſequentiall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith are articles of faith: and in a word all conſequences drawne as neceſſarily flowing from, or grounded upon Scripture principles, theſe are of Scripturall warrant. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. 46, 47. maketh a promiſe, yea an old teſtament promiſe, to bee virtually a command, yea a new Teſtament commandement: Loe wee turne to the Gentiles; why ſo? For God hath ſo commanded us; How doth that appeare, or where? It followeth, ſo hath God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſaying, I have ſet thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou ſhouldeſt bee my ſalvation to the ends of the earth: this was ſpoken too in <hi>Eſay</hi> 42. and 49. and it was a gracious promiſe in the letter of it; yea but <hi>Paul</hi> rightly drew the force of a command as included in it, according to the old rule; Hee which promiſeth the end, hee commandeth the meanes tending to that end; but of this more hereafter, but here wee ſee what ground worke is made uſe of in way of authoriſing ſo great and waighty a matter upon. It's verily the mind of God and Chriſt that Baptiſme and the Lords Supper ſhould bee adminiſtred to the worlds end; yet is it onely to bee drawne by Scripture conſequence from ſuch like places, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. So when it's ſaid, As oft as yee doe this: our Divines make account it is a virtuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to celebrate the Lords Supper often: and not, as in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, twice or thrice a yeare. That ſiſters as well as brethren ſhould in caſe bee eccleſiaſtically cenſured it is of Scripture warrant; yet by conſequence onely; for the rule is of a brother offending, &amp;c. nor is [brother] of the common gender, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6. 14. And as in matter of practiſe, ſo of faith, it is thus; in Chriſts time there was no other Scripture, how then ſhould that great article of the reſurrection bee convincingly proved, even to learned Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces which deny it? verily an old Teſtament proofe Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth account ſufficeth, as that <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 29. 31, 32. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6, &amp;c. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 37. yet this was but drawne by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Thus the orthodox fathers dealt againſt the Arrians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Chriſt to bee eſſentially one with the Father, they held him forth to bee <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41963:72"/> was to bee worſhipped they did the like: And where is it otherwiſe then by conſequence to bee drawne from Scripture, that there are three diſtinct perſons or ſubſtances in that one God? or that Chriſt hath two natures eſſentially diſtinguiſhed, and yet united in one Perſon, &amp;c? Circumciſion is called a ſigne of the covenant, how did <hi>Paul</hi> in ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham</hi> mention circumciſion as the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of his faith? whence drew hee that, that circumciſion was in the nature of it; elſe it had not beene ſo to <hi>Abraham</hi> or any other, any ſuch thing? verily it was from Scripture conſequence. And as in matters of faith and practiſe, ſo in matters of fact, the ſame rule holds, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 4. there were foure thouſands <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        <hi>hominum,</hi> a word of the common gender, which beleeved: What no woman among them, none of their wives? that were very ſtrange, but were they not baptized? Anabaptiſts will yeeld ſurely they were, yea but that muſt bee drawne by conſequence. The Church of the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, Coloſſians, Epheſians, &amp;c.</hi> ſurely had the Lords Supper admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred among them, ſo the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the ſeven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches had baptiſme adminiſtred to and among them, yet this muſt bee drawne by conſequence, or no way, according to that true rule all this is regular, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Scripture is not the letter alone, but the minde and intent thereof drawne by conſequence, according to the Analogy of faith, and by this rule wee are to hold forth the doctrine of faith and rule of manners and worſhip, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. Elſe as well many abſurdities would follow. Muſt wee actually ſell all, taking up a Gibbet daily, lend freely, looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againe, turne the other cheeke to him which ſmiteth one, plucke out our eyes, cut off right hands, &amp;c? Analogy of faith muſt helpe here. Hence Evangelicall duties are not alwayes grounded upon expreſſe commandements, either in old or new Teſtament, but from conſequences drawne from either: ſuch as are praying morning and evening in the family, and alſo in the cloſet alone; conſtant, daily and ſet meditation; daily reading of the Scriptures in the family: holy vowing, ſetting a part ſolemne dayes in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or publique for thankſgiving, &amp;c. much leſſe are many of theſe come over againe, as ſome phraſe it, in the new Teſtament, with mention of the perſons thereunto oblieged: thereby receiving their binding virtue; nor is that therefore ſound that in point of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is excluded which is not expreſſed; doe not ſuch even grant conſequences?</p>

Circumciſion is confeſſed to bee an appointed ſeale of initiation to them that entered into covenant with God before Chriſts incarnation, and baptiſme ſuch a ſeale ſince; and that it ſignified ſanctification by the Spirit, juſtification and ſalvation by Chriſt, and faith in him, but as to come, and baptiſme as come, &amp;c. and is this no priviledge to beleevers, that now they have not that manner of initiation by circumciſion; yea but in a better way they have, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by baptiſme? Chriſt indeed was then to the Saints, and ſo hee is now all in all ordinances and priviledges; the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that firſt, or principall one, <hi>Eſay</hi> 41. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. but it was not therefore no priviledge, nor is now the like, to have together with Chriſt many pretious ordinances diſpenſed to them and us: and verily the Scripture in old and new Teſtament, accounteth it no ſmall priviledge, to have Gods Tabernacle and Sanctuary, Church and Church ordinances with us; and perſons to bee in and under the ſame; hence promiſed as a reward and a fruit, yea part of the ratification of his covenant with them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 9. 11. and therefore in the choyſe times of the Goſpel, it's ſo reckoned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 3. yea and as of old the childrens Church eſtate and priviledge was therein included as of that nature: ſo in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the other times mentioned, was the ſame of the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as wee have ſhewed from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25, 26, 27.</p>

                        <label>4.</label> THat Baptiſme is now the onely initiatory viſible ſeale of the covenant; which being once adminiſtred, there needs no more renewing of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is a ſeale of the covenant, no bare badge of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as ſome have ſaid, albeit the more judicious of our oppoſites yeeld this, that <q rend="inline">the covenant of grace is ſaid properly to bee ſealed in Baptiſme, and that Baptiſme ſince Chriſts incarnation, is the appointed ſeale of God to ſuch as enter into covenant with him.</q> And it appeares ſo, 1. In that it agreeth in the eſſentialls with circumciſion as an initiatory ſeale, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. whence baptized Gentiles are ſaid to be of the circumciſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and Jewes ſaid to bee baptized, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. hence firſt inſtituted for a ſeale to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Jewes; to ſhew it was in the eſſentialls of ſealing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> covenant to them, but the ſame with circumciſion in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; onely as that ſealed it to them viſibly in Chriſt, as to come, this did it in like ſort in reference to Chriſt as come: that was the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, or that whereon his faith acted to righteouſnes of juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. even the promiſe of grace in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 14. hence when Chriſt is called the Miniſter of circumciciſion, it is thus explained by the end of the ſigne adminiſtred, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to confirme the promiſes made unto the fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. hence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe premiſed, and then baptiſme annexed as the ſeale, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. hence that waſhing annexed to the word, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26. 2. It's a Baptizing in the name or covenant fellowſhip of God the Father, Sonne and Spirit: hee having exalted his word above all his name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 2. 3. It's a ſeale of remiſſion of ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the promiſe tendering the ſame, hence joyned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 4. The nature of it ſheweth the ſame, it being a Goſpell Sacrament, and that is a viſible ſeale, and the ſeale is to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, hence called by the name, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is an initiatory ſeale: as firſt, annexed to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell diſpenſed, with reference to covenant fellowſhip with God in Trinitie; not firſt, Diſciple them, and then, let them come to my Table, but baptizing them, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſo ſoone as ever brought into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Church eſtate, and ſeale them up thereby unto cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fellowſhip with the Father, Sonne and Spirit. Hence repent and bee baptized, for the promiſe is to you; not, repent and come to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41963:74"/> the Lords Table; for the promiſe is to you. Hence that order obſerved of communion in breaking of bread after they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41, 42, 43, 44. there <hi>John</hi> began in any ſealing way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Marke</hi> 1. As of old circumciſion long before the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, hence called the waſhing of regeneration; metonymically at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the thing ſealed, to the viſible ſeale, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. the new birth is the firſt fruits of the ſpirit of promiſe: nor is this aſcribed to the other Sacrament as that which is its proper Sacramentall worke initiatorily to ſeale; albeit after it bee thus initiatorily ſealed by baptiſme, the other doth alſo virtually confirme it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this being once adminiſtred needs never bee renewed, as if two initiations or beginnings, or regenerations, or firſt ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances into covenant, or firſt ingraffings into Chriſt, &amp;c. as there was not Iterations of circumciſion. It were but to take the name of God in vaine, and a wilworſhip indeed, if ever before diſpenſed in the truth of the eſſentialls of the ordinance, and it were unſafe to ſay, wee may renew that one baptiſme, as wee may renue that one faith of ours, unleſſe as many times in a day: and as in variety of occurrents, changes, ſervices, ſufferings, temptations, ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, buſineſſes, &amp;c. wee are to renue our faith, ſo wee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue our baptiſme, nor will the 19. of the <hi>Acts</hi> beare out any ſuch practiſe. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcourſe touching the manner of <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to hold forth the duty which God required in reference to the Lord Jeſus, and accordingly they were by <hi>John</hi> baptized into the name of Jeſus, whom <hi>John</hi> held forth, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5. compared ſhewes, and as the annexing of <hi>Pauls</hi> name, 1. to this declaration, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5. and then 2. to his act which hee then did, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>inceth: It's not ſaid, then <hi>Paul</hi> baptized them, but then <hi>Paul</hi> laid his hands upon them. It's ſaid of the other ſeale, As oft as yee doe this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. But not a whiſper that way touching being oft baptized. The Apoſtle in mentioning of one ſpirit, body, hope of our calling, metonymically put for the thing hoped for, even glory, which is but one eſſentially, as one faith: which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is taken, as oft in Scripture, for the doctrine of faith, which is but one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. 7, 8. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. and ſo one Lord and one God: hee mentions one baptiſme: and why doth hee not as well ſay one Lords Supper too, which albeit oft renewed to the ſame perſons, yet it's but one inſtitution and the ſame ordinance ſtill: if no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter bee in that oneneſſe of baptiſme, but to ſignifie, that it's one and the ſame baptiſme indeed, but yet ſo as that it hinders
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41963:75"/> not, but it may often bee renued upon one and the ſame perſon warrantably, though it were before orderly adminiſtred to him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that baptiſme is the onely initiatory ſeale: I never heard this yet ſo much as queſtioned by any which deny it not to bee a ſeale, therefore I need not ſpeake any further in confirmation thereof.</p>

Ere wee confirme this, let us premiſe that, that covenant <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. was a covenant of grace, and it was made with reference to an ordinary politicall viſible Church, as we have before ſhewed. And albeit that Church, <hi>quà</hi> ſuch a politicall Church &amp; nationall, &amp;c. differ from congregationall Churches: yet <hi>quâ viſibil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

As for their externall intereſt alſo in the covenant of ſaving grace, it hath been likewiſe cleared, &amp; that alſo need not breed contention upon the point of diſparity.</p>
                     <p>This being premiſed, the propoſition may more eaſily proceed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. God propoundeth his gratious covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth of one externall condition to bee obſerved, by perſons taken into that gratious covenant, and inferreth the condition upon the premiſed covenant: thou <hi>Abraham</hi> and thy ſeed after thee: and when <hi>Iſaac</hi> with whom — this covenant is eſtabliſhed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. as in whoſe race the Church and Church ſeed is to bee continued hath ſeed; then it is thou, and thy ſeed: and when <hi>Jacob</hi> hath his ſeed, it is ſtill the ſame, thou and thy ſeed, in ſuch covenant lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, what hee ſpeaketh to one father hee ſpeaketh to others; all are but <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed ſtill: yea and as then the ſame to <hi>Abrahams</hi> beleeving ſeed with their children, ſo it's but the ſame now; thou beleever and thy ſeed after thee, are the ſame parties as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; yea thou <hi>Abraham</hi> and thy ſeed after thee, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in their generations; wherein fathers and children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and begotten are comprehended: And ſo now <hi>Abrahams</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:41963:75"/> ſpirituall ſeed in their generations, are <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; thus farre it's the ſame: yea, but what muſt <hi>Abraham</hi> and this his ſeed doe, and therefore doe becauſe in covenant? they muſt keepe the covenant. But ſome are Infants there intended in the ſeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, and ſeed in their generations, how can they keepe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Yes verily in the ſenſe intended they may, <hi>ſcil.</hi> receive ſuch a covenant and Church initiatory ſeale, as he ſhall appoint to them, according to their outward capacitie, elſe to imagine any other externall way of their keeping of covenant, it were vaine. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his adult beleeving ſeed, which ſo farre forth hee as <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis perſona</hi> did therein repreſent, they may keepe Gods covenant many other wayes; but the Infant ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving children, then or now cannot externally and actually keepe the covenant and externall condition thereof otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>And let it bee attended, that the wiſe, gratious covenanter, and Law giver of his Church, hee diſtinctly layeth downe; firſt, this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule and principle with the ground of it; before hee inſtance in, or pitch upon any particular way or branch thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this generall being with greateſt wiſedome thus laid downe, it muſt have its diſtinct conſideration and weight by, and in it ſelfe, <hi>abſolutè,</hi> as well as any particular branch thereof may, and doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the like, or as even this generall may have its conſideration alſo, <hi>comparatè,</hi> in reference to any ſuch particular. Hee that were to preach of this Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9. might and would ſo handle it, and raiſe diſtinct obſervations from it: if one were to deale with an adult perſon, a ſeeker; which denyeth all viſible Church ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, &amp;c. and onely pleads intereſt in the promiſe, in Chriſt, and the Spirit and Father, ſpirituall illuminations, and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and quicknings promiſed; this Scripture ground amongſt others, might now bee urged: Thou ſhalt therefore, even becauſe of the promiſe and covenant, keepe my covenant, ſaith the Lord. Yea ſuppoſe it were ſome Jew that ſhould bee converted, and not deny the ordinances of Baptiſme, but like as many in former times, as <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius,</hi> and divers others did upon unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds, hee ſhould deferre his baptiſme too long, and nelect it too much, pleading the fulneſſe of the covenant: and that all in all ordinances is their and in the branches of it, the promiſes, as in the well-ſprings, <hi>Eſay</hi> 12. 3. this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9. might bee very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently urged to him, Thou ſhalt therefore keepe my covenant; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then hee muſt deny this Sacrament to bee any externall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41963:76"/> of the covenant, on our parts, as well as a viſible ſeale thereof on Gods part; which were ridiculous or if it bee yeelded to bee a dutie on mans part externally in covenant, then it is manifeſt indignitie to God, yea a breach of covenant to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, as receiving the initiatory Sacrament, is a ſpeciall branch of keeping Gods covenant, ſo neglect or contempt thereof, muſt bee acknowledged to bee a ſpeciall breach of it, and as much might bee urged in reſpect of neglect or contempt of the initiatory ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their ſeed, or children; both are equally made Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to bee kept, or the covenant condition and dutie which moſt immediatly and neceſſarily and properly doth follow thence. Hence this is firſtly, and principally here included, as the keeping of Gods covenant, by the perſons intereſted therein according to their outward capacitie of it.</p>
                     <p>This royall generall covenant Law, was not ceremoniall, nor was the ground work of it ceremonial: that covenant, I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed, was not ceremoniall &amp; vaniſhing, but an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, &amp; if everlaſting then an immutable covenant, even the ſame to the worlds end; that inference of this covenant duty, laying upon ſuch as were externally intereſted in it, as propounded with Church reference; Thou ſhalt therefore keepe my covenant, and thy ſeed after thee; this was not ceremoniall. That covenant du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the generall, and the keeping of it, I meane an initiatory viſible ſeale of the covenant, and the receiving of it, was not in the nature of it ceremoniall; for then every ſpecies of this ſubalterne genus an initiatory covenant ſeale, had been aboliſhed by Chriſts comming, and ſo not circumciſion onely in the ſymboll, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of it, but in the genericall nature of it as an initiatory ſeale and ſenſe of the righteouſneſſe of faith, intereſt in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp;c. and ſo baptiſme too, had never been inſtituted: becauſe it had been then to revive aboliſhed ceremonies, &amp;c. this generall Law was never repealed or aboliſhed. Say then that particular way of initiation firſt pitched upon on this ground worke: namely cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of the foreskin of the fleſh, and that of males of eight dayes old, &amp;c. were ceremoniall, yet this generall covenant Law, muſt not run parallel with it too. I conclude then that particular way alſo of initiation unto covenant, and Church fellowſhip by Baptiſme of confederate parents and their ſeed as it is a covenant duty, of which more anon, ſo it depends upon externall covenant intereſt; nor let any here interrupt the proceeding hereof with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41963:76"/> the old cavill touching covenant females; it hath been ſaid their naturall incapacity of that former way of initiation, exempted them then, and yet not now. Nor yet doth that any way invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the concluſion propounded, no more doth the objecting of <hi>Job.</hi> It's likely hee had a family Church which was not to abide, and was a peculiarity of thoſe times, and no ordinary viſible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall Church in reference whereunto wee ſpeake: So to what ſome object about any beleevers in <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>India, &amp;c.</hi> we ſay, ſuch pearles are not ordinarily looked for in ſuch dunghils, nor would any ſeeke ſuch living ones amongſt thoſe dead perſons, they are not a formed matter of a politicall viſible Church, but they are as <hi>materia informis.</hi> They are <hi>quoad homines</hi> actually without, and not within any politicall viſible Church. The covenant of grace nakedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered giveth a perſon which is actually in it, a remote right to the initiatory ſeale, but it doth not give an immediate right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for ſo the covenant of grace as inveſted with Church cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant onely giveth this proximate right to that ſeale. God being the God of order, will have that his Church ſeale to bee attained in a way of order; as of old ſtrangers might not bee circumciſed, but with ſome ſubmiſſion to that Church order explicitly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, and ſo now; the orderly and ordinary diſpenſation of the ſeale is committed to the viſible Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. ſo that what ever right any have to the ſeale, which are not of any particular viſible Church, yet they muſt come by the uſe of their right in a way of order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Object.</label> Yea but the <hi>Catechumens</hi> were in covenant and viſible Church eſtate, yet were not preſently baptized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Anſw.</label> If they were in covenant and Church eſtate, they had then and thereby right ſo farre forth to the ſeale: but there might bee ſome other actuall cauſes why ſuch adult new commers on from Paganiſme, might bee ſuſpended a while, the uſe and actuall benefit of their right; yet that hinders not but that in covenant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in whom there are no ſuch actuall impediments, that they ſhould be ſuſpended, much leſſe wholly denied, as by Anabaptiſts they are, either any right, or uſe of their right to Baptiſme.</p>

                        <label>6.</label> ANd becauſe in this particular, ſome ſtreſſe of the maine caſe is put, 1. I ſhall indeavour yet further to confirme it, that covenant intereſt carryeth a maine ſtroake in point of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41963:77"/> of that ſeale, to perſons intereſted therein, and not uncapable thereof in any bodily reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, then it is the ground worke given to the generall Law, about an initiatory covenant duty, <hi>ſcil.</hi> application of ſome injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned initiatory ſeale, and therefore muſt bee of like force in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branches and wayes of ſuch initiatory ſealing, as circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then and baptizing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the covenant in ſuch ſort inveſted with Church cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, now it is the forme of a politicall viſible Church body; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore, both a Church being as I may ſay, as naturall formes doe a naturall being, and withall the priviledge of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch a Church body, ſuitable to its memberly eſtate, as is this of the Church initiatory ſeale, even to the leaſt member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, although they are not yet ſo perfect in all actuall energy of compleat members, and ſo neither in all actuall priviledges of ſuch compleat members. I ſuppoſe what ever others deny this way, yet our oppoſites doe not deny, that Church covenant explicit or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit is the forme of a viſible politicall Church as ſuch; ſo that till that be, they are not ſo incorporated as to be fit for Church diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, or acts of peculiar Church power over each other, more then over others, over whom they can have no power unleſſe they had given explicit, or implicit conſent thereto: as reaſon will evince.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, even in doubtfull caſes, where the extent of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is queſtionable, yet intereſt in the covenant caſts the ſcoales. As for inſtance, in ſtrangers which proved religious, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it not of their family ſervants, and ſo under the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12, 13. they might bee circumciſed, if they deſired other Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, &amp;c. yet were they elſe free, unleſſe in ſuch a caſe of their owne deſire that way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>end.</hi> Hence <hi>Cornelius</hi> a godly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, living neare the Jewes, yet not circumciſed, as <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. compared with Chap. 11. 3. 14, 15. 18.</p>
                     <p>Yea but if the command bound them, why were they at ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie? and if no binding command for their circumciſion, why were they circumciſed? ſuppoſe <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. gave ſome libertie to the Church guides that way, for ſuch ſtrangers as more uſually dwelt amongſt them; yet ſuch as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8, 41, 42, 43. which came from farre, in a meere tranſient way, for ſome temporary religious worſhip at the Temple, as that proſelyted Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 27. thoſe were ſurely circumciſed, elſe how admitted to temple wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41963:77"/> ſince that was counted an abomination, for any other ſo much as to come there, <hi>Acts</hi> 21 28. and if circumciſed at any time by any of the godly Church guides conſent, what gave them right to it? not the commandement, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12, 13, 14. no nor that <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. what was that to an Eunuchs caſe and others which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſojourned with them for any ſpace? were they then unlawfully circumciſed? no verily, no whiſper of that in Scripture, God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of that paſſage in <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer, touching the ſtrangers temple ſervice, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. and 9. explained. It was then their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall intereſt in Gods gratious covenant, which gave riſe to that application of the ſeale, and not the commandment; contrary to what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome ſay, that not the covenant but the commandment of God onely, was the ground of circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it appeares from the nature of an initiatory ſeale of the covenant, which muſt bee as large as the covenant, and ſo reach all the parties comprehended actually by vertue of covenant; according as ſuch children are, as before declared: eſpecially ſince it is the ſeale of Gods people, and viſible Church as before ſhewed, given firſt for the Church, in giving of paſtors and teachers onely to the Church, which alone can adminiſter the ſeales in ordinary diſpenſations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>end,</hi> and giving them withall to the Church, as from her to bee diſpenſed by her officers, to ſuch as deſire the ſame. Now Gods people are knowne, either by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſonall profeſſion and confeſſion of their owne, as adults are; or by Gods promiſe, and by parents avouching God as theirs in covenant and their childrens, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. thou ſhalt doe thus and thus, and thy ſeed alſo; to which he ſubmitteth afterwards, and ſo his alſo with him, and after him, beſides the maine in the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory ſeale to bee firſtly and properly attended, as it is a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Church ſeale, is covenant and Church intereſt. Hence called by the name of covenant, when yet it is but a Sacramentall ſigne and ſeale of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 7, 8. that is firſt held out and ſealed as the convoy of all other deſired good, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. But eſpecially in that initiatory ſeale, the <hi>ſignatum</hi> of the covenant, is of more conſiderable weight, then the externall Symboll, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and circumſtance: either of cutting or waſhing abſolutely, or relatively conſidered. If waſhing of a perſon in the name of the Trinitie bee a clearer, and eaſier Symboll then that of cutting the fleſh, yet not of ſuch weight as is the covenant ſealed, both by the one and by the other, And to ſhew that the covenant is the maine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41963:78"/> thing conſiderable therein; hence it is that the covenant is firſt propounded as the groundworke of the commandement it ſelfe, as of circumciſion, ſo of Baptiſme, and much more of the application of either, to any in covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10, 11. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ſcil.</hi> becauſe I have ſaid I will bee your God, I command you to doe thus and thus, not becauſe I have commanded you, that I therefore promiſe to doe this for you, or doe you thus and thus at my command, and then on, therefore I will doe ſo and ſo for you. So the Goſpell propheſie and promiſe is prefaced, and put in the preamble to that injunction of their Baptiſme, by <hi>John, Luke</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. Hence the Goſpell, and ſo the covenant of grace, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld out as grounding Baptiſme, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. And childrens co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant right, was held out as one branch of that Goſpell, as wee proved; and from the ſame principle, that they were alſo to bee ſealed by Baptiſme; yea albeit the Apoſtles urged repentance, yet the ſeale is propounded as to the promiſe; <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, Bee baptized, for the promiſe is to you; and this was no meere morall motive but a Scripturall groundworke inforcing it, as it was a Scripture groundwork virtually injoyning and requiring them to repent; for the promiſe is to you, ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith there is no let to their baptiſme; and thereof he maketh the viſibilitie of that covenant grace, although common to reprobates alſo in thoſe firſt times, his groundworke; gathering thereby, that they were not now as formerly prophane, uncleane and outlaries from the covenant, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. but cleane, and nigh as they themſelves were. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of regeneration is not grounded on any thing in us or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, ſo much as on Gods grace, and ſo covenant favour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Hence alſo by Baptiſme perſons are not ſealed into any thing in them ſo much as into the name of the Father, Sonne and Spirit, even into the covenant name of grace, whereby he is knowne, and into covenant fellowſhip with the bleſſed Trinitie, to which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry baptized perſon, prove hee elect or reprobate, yet is thus exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſealed. That fellowſhip with Chriſt as head of the viſible Church by the Spirit in the judgement of veritie, or charitie ſuch; it is all but covenant grace and bleſſing. Of old the conſequent cauſe of the ſeale was grace in them and theirs; but the antecedent cauſe was Gods covenant grace to them and on them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. and ſo now, that part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant was not then appliable to Infants, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Walke before mee, &amp;c. but yet that was then appliable; I will bee their God, I will circumciſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41963:78"/> their hearts, and that ſufficed them, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. the Analogy holds now; in a word the ſeale, is a ſeale not of nor to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but covenant; this therefore is the maine and principall in the application of it.</p>
                     <p>It is the covenant which hath the maine inſtrumentall force, in the fruit of the initiatory ſeale, and the application of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26. and why ſhall not the externall intereſt in the covenant, have chiefe influence into the externall intereſt, as well of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the initiatory ſeale? by externall intereſt in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, perſons ſo intereſted come to have externall intereſt at leaſt, to the finall cauſes of Baptiſme, as covenant mercy and bleſſing, the Spirit, Chriſts reſurrection, &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. and therefore as well ſo farre inrighted in the initiatory ſeale of it, whether they are adult or Infants.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41963:79"/> with whom the covenant priviledge ſhall abide, hee is ſo excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and it was accounted a ſore puniſhment to him and his, as if the contrary were a choyſe priviledge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24, &amp;c. by alluſion; before that hee was eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diſcovered, the covenant is ſealed upon him perſonally, but before ever hee have children, hee is diſcovenanted, and diſchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for his wickedneſſe, by Gods hand; &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, &amp;c. and that was his puniſhment that hee is a diſcovenanted, and externally diſchurched and open excommunicate perſon when hee came to have children, and ſo they have no benefit. <hi>Caines</hi> exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diſcovenanting, and diſchurching in a parentall as well as perſonall way, was his ſore puniſhment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 12, 13, 14. with 6. 1, 2. his poſteritie have the common name of children of men, and not as thoſe of <hi>Seth,</hi> children of God; ſuch exceptions did God uſe ſome way or other, to expreſſe where hee intended not this covenant priviledge; Verily ſo long as Gods gracious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with Church reference, to inchurched confederate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and their generations to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſpirituall ſeed in their generations for an everlaſting covenant, his mind of grace touching an externall initiatory ſealing, eſtabliſhing and ratifying the ſame to them, abideth: nor may any change, or repeale the ſame, or infringe, or curtaile the latitude of it, unleſſe himſelfe doe it, as it is in all other royall grants, and lawes ſtanding in force, untill repealed by them, by whom granted and made; hence that ſigne is called by the name of the covenant, as virtually in it, and annexed ordinarily to it; extraordinary times as thoſe before, infringe not the ordinary courſe, as before ſhewed; hence even that ſealing ſaid to be for an everlaſting covenant; partly in that it was a ſeale of that covenant ſo induring, and partly becauſe preſidentially and in the genericall nature of it, to abide, the Church and covenant people of God combined, being never after to want an externall initiatory ſeale of the covenant. Hence alſo among other cauſes God inſtituteth baptiſme, firſt for the Jewiſh Church, and ſo continued the uſe of it to, and amongſt Gentile Churches; there was no <hi>interſtitium,</hi> nor was it ever accounted a branch of the exhibition of New teſtament grace and a priviledge of covenant inchurched parents, to have their children want, and bee deprived of any externall covenant, and Church intereſt; but rather that initiatory ſealing of inchurched parents, little ones have ever been accounted by all true viſible Churches to bee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41963:79"/> way of exhibition of the grace of God and Chriſt. Surely, there being ſo many paſſages mentioned formerly touching this part of Gods minde of grace once, if they were intended to bee invalid in any ſuch way now, and yet God never expreſſed his minde for repeale of ſuch ſubſtantiall branches of his minde of Grace, towards his people and Churches; there are ſo far ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks laid before them to occaſion miſtakes: For who will not take the ſame for granted, which conſiders the ſame adviſedly, as indeed the Churches of old have done before?

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41963:80"/> with them, according as they are outwardly capable thereof. As it is their priviledge to have it ſo, ſo is it their charge and dutie to take wiſe, faithfull and ſeaſonable care that it be ſo done. <hi>Abraham</hi> alone is not to bee circumciſed, but his ſeed alſo, which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally capable thereof, are to be ſo initiated &amp; ſealed unto covenant and Church fellowſhip. It was onely <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom God then appeared, and declared his covenant and mind of grace touching his and his ſeeds ſealing, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> is not ſpoken to in the one or other reſpect, as to a meere particular man, but as to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and repreſentative perſon alſo, imbracing and owning a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious covenant, and the generall condition at leaſt of it: As on his owne particular behalfe, ſo on the behalfe both of the choyce ſeed of his loynes in their generations, together with the reſt of his Church ſeed by <hi>Iſaac</hi> in their generations: as alſo with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reference, in the eſſentialls of both covenant and condition of it, unto his ſpirituall ſeed in their generations, after Chriſts aſcenſion, which were to bee of the Gentiles, and of the Jewes: both before their rejection, and upon their re-ingraffing into viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church eſtate. Hence in mentioning that particular way of initiation by circumciſion, firſt pitcht upon, plurall phraſes are uſed, when <hi>Abraham</hi> onely is in preſence. The covenant which yee ſhall keepe, And each manchild amongſt you, And my covenant ſhall bee in your fleſh, And it ſhall bee a token of the covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt mee and you, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt ſee all this performed, and hee did ſo, ſo farre as it could bee done at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>Abraham</hi> enters into this holy bond, and thereby the obligation became of force upon his children which were not then preſent. Hence, the parents act of neglect, is temporally at leaſt corrected in the little child, even as the parents bond was the childs obligation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 14. Hence too, that God might further evince it to bee mainly the parents duty, even godly <hi>Moſes</hi> the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is indangered for the neglect of the ſealing of his child, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 2. 4, 5, 6. where by the way, let it bee noted, that albeit upon ſome ceremoniall grounds, the mind of God being that way made knowne, their marriages of old with heathens became ſo farre un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, that even their children alſo were diſcarded, yet was it not morally and of it ſelfe of that nature, even amongſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church, that the children of ſuch Church members, begotten upon heathen wives, not of the Church, were uncleane, and not to bee ſealed by that initiatory Church ſeale. For God
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41963:80"/> himſelfe is angry with <hi>Moſes</hi> here, becauſe his ſonne by that <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> wife was not circumciſed. And long after it was counted of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive if the ſonne of a Jewiſh wife, even by a Grecian husband, were not that way initiated, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3, which is the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted caſe, occaſionally mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. But to returne to the propoſition before laid downe.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame ground mentioned it was, that when <hi>Peter</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his hearers to bee baptized, hee groundeth that motion, not barely upon their owne intereſt in the promiſe, but withall upon their childrens joynt intereſt with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. Bee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, for the promiſe is to you, and to your children: why putteth hee that groundworke ſo largely, but to ſhew that the viſible ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory ſeale of the promiſe muſt bee as large as the promiſe? Their childrens baptiſme is virtually called upon too, as well as their owne. The parents are to take care of their baptiſme as well as their owne: the children being capable of externall baptiſme, that new way of initiation into covenant fellowſhip, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As they were alſo to carry home, as it were, the ſame charge upon the ſame ground touching repentance; urging that upon their children, as they ſhould bee capable of it, from the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ground, as themſelves had been urged thereto. <hi>Noah</hi> alone muſt not bee baptized in that extraordinary and typicall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but his children with him muſt in like ſort bee baptized, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 1. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. 21. God will have all theſe fathers, ſome whereof at that time mentioned were babes, yet in reſpect to after ages were fathers, to bee baptized in that extraordinary baptiſme in the ſea, and in the cloud, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 44. If a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-ſervant bee circumciſed himſelfe, hee may eate the paſſeover: for hee was not ſo bound as the Jewes, by command to either cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion or the paſſeover; but hee is to circumciſe his males, with that reaſon annexed: For no uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eate thereof. What is the meaning hereof? Is it thus? elſe none of thoſe his males or male children; for they are moſt properly his, and in the caſe of ſtranger, which was an houſhold ſervant, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will tell us, ſuch a one had no ſervants of their owne, none of theſe being uncircumciſed, ſhould eate the paſſeover? No verily. For 1. That was not the caſe mentioned, of ſuch a ſtrangers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that his males ſhould eate of the Paſſeover, but that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might doe it, if hee, not if they, will eate of the Paſſeover: and the Text is cleare otherwiſe; let his males bee circumciſed,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41963:81"/> and then let him, not let them come neare and eate the Paſſeover. 2. The rule touching one that eateth the Paſſeover is there laid downe; Let him eate the Paſſeover, to the Lord, <hi>ſcil.</hi> with holy actuall obedience to the Lords mind, and aimes at his ends, &amp;c. which Infants are not capable of performing: which by the way, note againſt ſuch as tell us, the Jewiſh Infants did eate the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when as the law herein is expreſly ſaid to bee the ſame to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites as to ſtrangers, and what that Law was wee have now ſeene, <hi>verſe</hi> 48, 49. compared. But who then is the uncircumciſed perſon, which may not in this caſe eate the paſſeover, if not the male children? Verily, the ſtranger parent mentioned, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit hee bee circumciſed himſelfe, as is ſuppoſed in <hi>verſe</hi> 44. yet if it bee the caſe of one circumciſed himſelfe, which hath male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to bee circumciſed; albeit as perſonally circumciſed, he might eate, <hi>verſ.</hi> 43, 44 yet in this caſe of deſiring the Paſſeover, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing or ſlighting the mention of circumciſing his males, hee is as if himſelfe were uncircumciſed in that reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ct; his contempt and diſregard of Gods covenant mercy to bee ſealed upon his children, maketh his circumciſion to bee uncircumciſion: and the covenant of grace, by which himſelfe eſpecially came to have any right to the initiatory ſeale: That is not wholly ſealed if hee neglect the ſealing of his children, joyntly intereſted in an externall way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him. In which reſpects hee is as one uncircumciſed; hee may not eate the paſſeover. Hence, when the Lord was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his covenant, in reference to the initiatory ſealing of it, as on <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo on his Church ſeed in their generations, he then and never before, that I finde, delivered the Evangelicall covenant in that form, I wil be a God to thee, &amp; to thy ſeed after thee in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. And <hi>Abraham</hi> now hath that propounded, as a groundwork of initiatory ſealing, thou ſhalt therefore keep my covenant, thou and thy ſeed after thee. And then and not before, is his name changed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he hath then &amp; not till then, the name of father of many nations. As if herein God made him as a common perſon, as before I ſaid, as well in reference to us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched Gentiles, as to the inchurched Jewes, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes: in point of covenant intereſt, and ingagement from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant intereſt, unto the receiving of Gods initiatory ſeale by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children. And the reaſon is conſequentiall: If parents and children bee conſidered, as one covenant partie on the one ſide, admitted to covenant grace externally at leaſt, with God the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall covenanter, or covenant maker on the other part: Then,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41963:81"/> if the parents onely bee ſigned with the initiatory covenant ſeale, and the children which are capable of that ſeale are neglected, as opportunitie is offered, to bee likewiſe ſealed; the whole covenant of grace is not ſealed unto them ſo farre, not compleatly, as I may ſay ſealed on themſelves. The circumciſion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his a lone, was not that covenant or the ſigne of it, but with reſpect to the circumciſion of his ſeed alſo. The circumciſion of his ſeed alſo, was that covenant of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. In <hi>Abrahams</hi> ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatony ſealing unto the covenant, that covenant, I will bee a God to thy ſeed, as well as to thee, was ſealed, and ſo his childrens right with his owne, is thereby ſealed in part, but not compleatly, and fully without their ſealing alſo, as capable of it. So in the childrens being circumciſed, not onely their owne right in that, I will bee a God to thy ſeed, was externally ſealed, but <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant right in that, I will bee a God to thee, was alſo ſealed. So ſweetly were they both knit up in one common girdle, and that marked with one and the ſame marke of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 11. As the covenant was one, &amp; not two covenants, ſealed on both, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. So their ſealing was one collective and joynt condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>v.</hi> 8. And what I ſay of <hi>Abraham</hi> and that his ſeed, the ſame was true in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed in their generations, thoſe proſelyted houſhold ſervants, for ſuch proſelytes they were, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with their children; and ſuch families <hi>de jure</hi> at leaſt, the reſt were to be afterwards according to that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites in this point, would have the place onely to bee applyable to the perſonall eſtate of this or that beleever, Jew or Gentile, and of the perſonall way of their inſerting by true faith.

The other more particular and ſpeciall, whereby God maketh, as I may ſay, a ſecond draught, and out of ſuch or ſuch ſelected people culleth ſuch or ſuch particular perſons to bee ſaved by Chriſt: Now ſuch as are the ſubjects of election in this ſenſe, can never periſh, and in this ſenſe, the election among the Jewes attained it, and the reſt were blinded, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7. ſee <hi>John</hi> 10. 3. 11. 14. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p>As the Jewes are thus collectively conſidered, ſo the Gentiles comming into their Olive eſtate, are taken in a collective ſenſe, therefore called the world, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. the Gentiles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. notions not to bee reſtrained to the growne ſort of them, but neceſſarily including the ſpecies of Infants among them.

                        </gap>] as if hee would ſay, it is true; now growne ones among the Jewes were broken off: who came in their ſtead? growne Gentiles. True, but Jewiſh babes and little ones too, amongſt other branches and ſprigs, are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, that Gentiles might come into covenant and Church eſtate in their ſtead. What Gentiles? growne ones? nay roome is made for them in the breach of the growne Jewes. Verily then ſuch a like ſpecies of Gentiles unto thoſe rejected Jewiſh ſprigs, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Gentile babes and little ones, muſt neceſſarily bee thus inſerted and admitted into that covenant and Church eſtate out of which the other were broken. So then, as Jewes were, ſo Gentiles are conſidered in this Chapters diſcourſe touching communion in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall and Church ordinances and priviledges, under the notion of Olive fatneſſe, &amp;c. not in a bare perſonall way, but in reference to people of both kindes, and perſons of all ſorts, and ſpecies younger or elder, which is a ſtrong argument that God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to limit the benefit of his covenant grace to growne ones, or parents perſonally, but rather extends it to them in a parentall way at leaſt. Hence when that commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for this end, it is in the old terme and notion of nation, a large word, and ſubject. God delights to inlarge his grace in theſe times, and his very intent in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. is inlargement of Goſpel mercies.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41963:84"/> The more croſſe are their minds to Gods thoughts who from that very place would conclude a ſtraightning ſuch a Goſpell mercy as this mentioned, was and is both to parents and children, and for which they have nothing equivalent in ſtead thereof. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle it's confeſſed bringeth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16, 17. as an argument to prove the receiving in againe of the Jewes, <hi>ſcil.</hi> unto actuall fruition of all covenant and Church priviledges, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. For if the roote bee holy, ſo are the branches, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. and ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29. To the ſame purpoſe now, if the covenant with godly anceſtors bee ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to fetch in ſuch Apoſtates after ſo groſſe and long a time of their deſperate revolts from, and contempts of covenant grace in Chriſt; is it not much more of force to the receiving in of the babes of next beleeving parents unto the viſible fellowſhip of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant grace? God forbid, that any ſhould obſtinately gaineſay it.</p>

S.</hi> ſaith in that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. is meant Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall, and yet the ſame author elſewhere would have it meant myſtically conſidered; and elſewhere, of union and communion with God in ordinances; and elſewhere of <hi>Abraham</hi> in his faith; and elſewhere of beleeving parents in part; for hee ſaith not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeving parents are the roote, &amp;c. not onely [in part, then ſuch parents are the root.] But indeed this author refuteth himſelfe, in that hee knoweth not where to fix. <hi>Abraham</hi> in his faith as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, and eying the covenant in this latitude, as to him, and his ſeed of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by propagation, and to the beleeving Gentiles with their ſeed by proportion, thus hee might bee a root in his faith; but if <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith bee conſidered in a meere perſonall reſpect, ſo neither Jewes nor Gentiles are properly, ſaid to bee inſerted into that, but rather into his faith with its object the covenant. It is improper to ſay of the Gentile that they ſtood in it, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in the root of faith, by faith, or that the Jew was broken off from <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſonall faith by unbeliefe. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was a ſaving faith, if this therefore had been in them all, or they in it, they had not fallen as many Jewes and Gentiles priviledged by externall covenant right, did and might; or ſuppoſing the root to bee meant, not of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but of Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> alſo affirmeth, who is elſewhere called a root, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 16. and 5. 5, &amp;c. if they had been in him, by any proper and inviſible union, neither thoſe of the Jewes had been, nor ſo many of Gentiles could have been
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41963:84"/> broken off, as they were, &amp; whole Churches of theſe are, witnes this Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which the Apoſtle wrote this. But otherwiſe, if underſtood of impropper and viſible union with Chriſt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible union with Chriſt myſticall; thus indeed many ſuch may fall away finally, as did theſe. Hence that <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. now in this ſenſe parents and children Inchurched, whether Jewes or Gentiles, by being in the holy root of thoſe covenant fathers, they are viſibly in that holy root Chriſt, or Chriſt myſticall, as was ſhewed. <hi>I. S.</hi> will and doth confeſſe the firſt fruits, of whom yet the ſame holy effect is affirmed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. to be theſe fathers, and why not then as wel the ſame fathers to bee the root? ſince the context cleareth it, that the Apoſtle intendeth the ſame of the ſelfeſame perſons under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Metaphors. Either then Chriſt is the firſt fruites, as well as roote intended, or thoſe fathers are the firſt fruites, as well as the root mentioned. Verily covenanting <hi>Abraham</hi> in reference to his ſeed is called a rock, whence that Church, as a Church was hewen; for in that ſenſe the Prophet ſpeakes to them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 51. 1, 2. yet is Chriſt the rock of the Church too in another ſenſe; and why is not <hi>Abraham</hi> then a covenant root to ſuch Church branches, as that from whence they in that ſenſe doe ſpring? And what I ſay of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is as well to bee referred to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the ſame reſpect, as being other veines, making up this one root, the Inſtrumentall meanes and cauſe of the mercy offered and exhibited both to Jewes and Gentiles, in regard that to them all this large covenant was made over in a radicall way, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 2. 7. and 22. 18. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 3, 4, 5. and 28. 13, 14. whence ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention in Scripture of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to covenant bleſſings, yea their names are pleaded in prayer for that end, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 27. ſee more 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 23. and <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 20. &amp;c. This was not in reſpect of any perſonall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of theirs, or barely in reſpect of their perſonall faith, but it was by reaſon of that large covenant made with them in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as the places quoted ſhew; ſee further for this end, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 71, 72. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 37. and 10. 15. with other like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Whence alſo, the Jewes which are called holy branches, by vertue of their holy root, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. they are termed naturall branches too, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of that root, and Olive tree, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. not naturall branches of Chriſt as the root. Our

Now as to Jewes, ſo to Gentiles, were thoſe covenant [fathers] and root; God ſaith to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> diſtinctly that hee would bleſſe all nations, and families, as in their ſeed, ſo in them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3.

Verily in reſpect of the covenant made with them, in reference as to the nation of the Jewes, and the families therein, ſo to Gentile nations and the families therein, to bee by virtue of that covenant partakers, at leaſt viſibly, of the covenant bleſſing. Hence wee Gentiles are ſaid to come and ſit downe with thoſe fathers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11, 12. as inſerted branches are in ſome ſenſe ſeated and ſetled in and with the root. Hence likewiſe, this root is ſaid to beare the Chriſtian Gentiles collectively taken, and for that cauſe the Gentile is not to boaſt againſt the Jew branches: branches of what? of the root mentioned: what root?

                     <p n="1">TO draw to a Concluſion. 1. Then looke how the Jew-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were ſet into their Olive and root mentioned, ſo are the Gentiles which come in their ſtead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. 19. But they with all their buds and ſprigs, <hi>ſcil.</hi> children, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. 3. and 18. 5. and 61. 9. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. 3. they are called, were ſet thereinto, therefore in like ſort are the Gentiles with their children inſerted. Amongſt them were three ſorts thus inſerted. 1. Growne ones truely beleeving, as were godly proſelyted Gentiles. 2. Growne ones, which did not prove truly beleeving, as many of the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes. 3. The children of Jewes, and of both thoſe ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, ſome whereof afterwards made holy improvement thereof, others abuſed and rejected their covenant priviledge: and ſo is it with us now.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Looke how they were by unbeleefe broken off, ſo are the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41963:86"/> taken in by faith; but they both parents and children were broken off through the unbeleeving rejection of the covenant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the wicked parents onely, therefore the Gentiles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted with their children, albeit the parents onely expreſſe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving embrace of the covenant. Gentiles children are not indeed expreſſed by name in this inſerting: but yet the Gentile is collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of as was proved, and ſo muſt needs include at leaſt the children of ſuch inſerted Gentiles; as in the cutting off of the Jewes, and caſting away of them, their children are not mentioned, except comprehenſively, here, or in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11. and 21. 42. yet all grant that they were intended, and ſo in this caſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Looke how the Gentile in caſe of apoſtaſie is cut off from his Church eſtate, and union and communion in the Olive root and fatneſſe, and looke as hee is not ſpared in caſe of his unbeleefe, ſo was the Gentile graffed in, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. 21, 22. But in that caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe and apoſtaſie, the Gentile, both parent and child is cut off from federall grace and Church priviledge; witneſſe the caſe of thoſe which at firſt fell off, when firſt the Aſian and other Churches, as of Rome, &amp;c. were unchurched: Therefore ſo was the Gentile parent and child graffed in.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Looke how the better part of the Jewes, which did not thus actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally &amp; obſtinately reject the covenant and Goſpel of grace, &amp; Chriſt the foundation thereof, did then, when the Apoſtle wrote this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. remaine ſtill in their roote: in ſuch ſort, are the Gentiles with them, partakers thereof: But thoſe Jewes parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren abode in that covenant eſtate: Therefore Gentile parents and children ſo partake with them. Of thoſe Jew parents none will make queſtion, and of their children, is no ground to doubt: which being once in covenant in their anceſtors, yea and parents right alſo, and not being then of yeares to reject Chriſt, how come they at preſent to bee cut out? ſurely not for their parents unbeleefe, for they receive Chriſt, not for others rejecting Chriſt, for what's that to them? not for their owne actuall rejecting of Chriſt, for they were not then of yeares to doe ſo.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Looke how the Jew ſhall againe bee graffed in, in ſuch ſort were the Gentiles at firſt graffed in, but they parents and children with them ſhall be graffed in; therefore ſo were the Gentile pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children graffed in or inchurched. The major is evident by <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. 19. 23, 24, 25, 26. compared: The minor is as evident by the ſame verſes compared. For as they were broken off by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41963:86"/> ſo are they re-inſerted by faith: now the former was by the parents unbeleefe, that young and old were caſt off, as was proved; therefore by faith in the parents, young and old are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſerted, elſe, as was ſaid, parents and children loſt this which was a ſpeciall and comfortable bleſſing by parentall unbeleefe, which they never recover through the like parentall faith. Beſides, it hath been proved, that the Apoſtles diſcourſe, both of the Jewes caſting off, and of their receiving in, is ſtill of them in a collective ſenſe, and not barely perſonall, and ſo their children cannot bee exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but muſt be included. Little ones are not indeed named in their re-ingraffing, no more then in their cutting off, yet as in the one, they are neceſſarily underſtood, ſo in the other. Beſides wee have before proved that the Jewes children are intereſted in theſe promiſes of grace, yet to bee fulfilled, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 9. and 65. 20. and 23. Their off-ſpring are the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, with them, or as well as themſelves: So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 20. to the end, and <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 19, 20. Their children ſhall bee as aforetime: how? in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and civill way meerely? nay rather in a Church way, as aforetime: now aforetime, who dare deny, but their children were eyed as in covenant, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. And as parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20, 21. 36. and therefore were they ſealed with that ſeale of the covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Hence ſome godly learned Divines in their Commentaries upon the <hi>Canticles,</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 11. 13. and Chap. 7. and 8. of the Jewiſh Church yet to come; they expound that <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 2. mentioned of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches navell, that wants not liquor, to be underſtood of Baptiſme, as that heape of Wheate, to bee meant of the Lords Supper to bee adminiſtred amongſt them.

                     <p n="6">6. Looke of what Olive fatneſſe in the ſubſtantialls thereof, and in what ſort thoſe branches did partake of the ſame, and in the ſame ſort doe the branches taken out of the wilde Olive partake. But thoſe branches did partake of the fruit cauſing fatneſſe of Olive, and Church ordinances and priviledges, not as ſhut up, or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41963:87"/> reſiding in the greater boughes, parents, but thorow them and by them paſſing to their leſſer ſprigs or children ſpringing from them. Therefore of ſuch fatneſſe doe and muſt Gentiles partake. And this way was their fall an inriching of the Gentile in-churched world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>ſcil.</hi> as this was to bee conveyed, as a covenant heritage, from beleeving parents to children. Elſe were it poore and ſad with beleevers. As with other parents in other heritages, if what they have in ſuch ſort, they cannot leave with, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally convey unto their children; as godly <hi>Joſeph</hi> is a fruitfull bough in reference to his flouriſhing branches, not in a meere ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and naturall, but in a covenant and Church reſpect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 22, 23. ſo is it with other ſuch parents as hee. It's contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Law, that any communicable ſappe ſhould be ingroſſed to, or ſhut up within the greater boughes, and not to bee withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed inſtrumentally to thoſe ſprigs that are upon them; ſo is it here, in reſpect of this communicable ſappe of federall and Church right in Church Olive boughes; It is contrary to the Law of the tenure of the covenant of grace made to parents with reſpect to their children in and with them, that this Church fatneſſe ſhould not bee conveyed to them. So farre as the greater boughes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into this viſible Olive Church eſtate, their ſprigs alſo which are on and in them, are ſet in with them, by the ſame Church act of ingraffing. If Olive roots as ſuch, ſhould not convey inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally their ſap and fatneſſe to the Olive boughes, as ſuch, and thoſe boughes in like ſort to their ſprigs, Olive trees would faile in an ordinary way: ſo in an ordinary way muſt Churches faile: if this eccleſiaſticall conveyance inſtrumentally of Church and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſap from parent to child be denied.</p>

                        </gap>, partakers in common in the root and fatneſſe of the Olive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
                     <p>A third reaſon thereof is in that the Olive here intended is that whoſe fatneſſe it is that is communicated to the branches: yea to ſuch branches as were broken off, as were many refuſe Jewes, or might bee broken off: as ſundry of the Gentiles which came in their ſtead might bee: whence that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. yea <hi>ver.</hi> 22. otherwiſe thou ſhalt bee cut off; and ſo many have beene witneſſes that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> and other Churches. Now ſaving graces peculiar to the elect, flow not from any company of men, no not from the inviſible Church, nor is it theirs but Chriſts to convey, and communicate, they cannot ſpare that oyle for others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 9. but the ordinances, and they are the Churches properly: and ſuch as from the Church are derived, and communicated to others whether elect, or reprobate that are members of her. Yea but what Church is that which holdeth forth, and diſpenſeth Church ordinances to others: not the inviſible Church: all the members being homogeneall, the inviſible Church properly hath not officers, if you ſuppoſe officers, you muſt ſuppoſe ſome calling, others called, and then they ceaſe to bee meerely inviſible, for in this act they become viſible: now a Church without officers cannot adminiſter all Church ordinances; not communicate that Church fatneſſe of the ſeales: ſo then the Olive Church communicating all Church fatneſſe indefinitely, and ſo the ſeales too, muſt bee the viſible, not the inviſible Church. Beſides ſince no Olive or Church fatneſſe is to bee had, but in, and from the Church: no Church ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ordinarily to be diſpenſed, but in, and from the Church: if the Olive here bee ſuppoſed to bee the inviſible, not the viſible Church, no ordinary communication of Church ordinances to any is poſſibly to bee had ſince the inviſible Church, being a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41963:91"/> Church onely of elect and ſavingly called perſons, and no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites or reprobates being in, or of that Church: whither ſhall any repaire for Church ordinances? there being no Church in the world, diſpenſing ordinances by ordinary officers, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can now diſpenſe them in a Church way; that conſiſts onely of elect ones: but there are ſome chaffe, and tares and traſh and veſſels of diſhonour in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. yea that Church being inviſible as ſuch is not obvious to the ſenſe of any, which being brought to the faith would deſire to bee joyned to this Olive thereby to partake of it's fatneſſe: hee cannot ſee where, nor what that Church is, for it is inviſible, this will drive us all to become Seekers, not till new Apoſtles come, as ſome fondly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but perpetually, yea hopeleſly.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it's not denied by ſuch as oppoſe us herein, that the Jewes had this priviledge, to bee reckoned in the outward admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the covenant of grace, as branches of the Olive by birth, by virtue of Gods appointment, which cannot bee true but in reference to the viſible Church.</p>

                     <p>1. THen ſome things in this order of Chriſt were perpetuall, as that preaching the Goſpel ſhould goe before Baptiſme, that baptiſme is to bee adminiſtred by ſuch as preach: that diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in-churched perſons, are to bee baptized: that in founding Churches, the firſt members are to bee viſible profeſſors of the faith in reference to Church eſtate: that baptiſme is with water to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the perſons baptized, and that into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne and holy Ghoſt. Yet <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> that all which here Chriſt held forth, is ſo ſtrictly to bee attended to the end of the world, as that which is to indure to the end of the world, or that what in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> hee propoundeth it is preſidentiall in all Church caſes of perſons to bee baptized, as alike, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction of Churches then, or now, gathering or to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. There is a commiſſion given to Elders or Churches, as here was to miniſters, <hi>James</hi> 5. 14. that they are to pray over the ſicke, and to anoint them with oyle: wee muſt now then without all diſtinction of times or Churches doe ſo too by Mr. <hi>Blackwoods</hi> argument; wee muſt ſtick to Scripture commiſſion of the Lord; as this was by his ſpirit, according as the other was <hi>viva voce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And let our oppoſites that urge <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> as preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall to all Churches and times, attend what is ſaid in <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18. if <hi>Marke</hi> 16. be the rule to us what perſons ſhould bee baptized onely, <hi>ſcil.</hi> beleevers, then few are to bee now bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but ſuch whoſe beleeving is attended with ſignes, that can caſt out devills, ſpeake with ſtrange tongues, take up Serpents, drinke deadly poyſon without hurt, or if any other are yet at leaſt ſome amongſt the baptized beleevers now as well as then, will have ſuch miraculous gifts. For Chriſt ſpeaking of ſome of thoſe bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed beleevers, at leaſt, albeit not of all, for all had not then gifts of miracles, and tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſaith, theſe ſignes ſhall follow them that beleeve, &amp;c. <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 17. and it was one continued ſpeech, and touching ſome of the perſons ſpoken of, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16. hence Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will never deny, unleſſe his reaſon faile him, but that ſuch kind of perſons were proper to bee found in thoſe firſt Churches, and times of firſt foundings of Churches amongſt the heathen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41963:92"/> And therefore, will hee nill hee, muſt he make a diſtinction of firſt Churches gathered, amongſt ſuch as never heard of Chriſt, and other Chriſtian Churches in theſe dayes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, bee it that it was Chriſts laſt commiſſion, yet it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appeares already that what he here held forth in this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous order about Gentile Churches, it was not therefore morall, and applyable to all times; no ſuch ſignes now following any belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving baptized members of Churches as did then. And if that very order of Chriſts laſt words were ſo morall, and ſtrictly to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: why doe the Evangeliſts, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſo vary in expreſſions, of thoſe laſt words of Chriſts order touching the Lords Supper? <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſſeth the Sacramentall actions of Chriſt, about the bread and cup, to bee as they were eating, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26, 27. and ſo <hi>Marke,</hi> Chap. 14. 22, 23. but <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſay hee tooke the cup after ſupper, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>Matthew, Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> make the Sacramentall promiſe, to bee uttered before the Diſciples dranke, even whilſt Chriſt gave order for their drinking: but <hi>Marke</hi> mentions the promiſe, This is my blood of the Teſtament, &amp;c. as ſpoken after they had all drunke of the cup, <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 23, 24. <hi>Luke</hi> addeth to what <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> ſay, This is my body which is given for you: <hi>Paul</hi> otherwiſe, which is broken for you: <hi>Matthew, Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> ſay of the bread, that Chriſt gave it to them; yet <hi>Paul,</hi> which affirmeth what hee had received, and did deliver accordingly to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> as from the Lord, he leaveth out that act of giving the bread; <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> ſay as much expreſly of the giving of the cup to them, which <hi>Paul</hi> omitteth. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> expreſſe that thus: This is my blood of the New Teſtament, which <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſe thus, This is the New Teſtament in my blood: <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> ſay, which was ſhed for many, <hi>Luke</hi> which is ſhed for you; <hi>Paul</hi> wholly omitteth it. <hi>Luke</hi> addeth in mention of the bread, Doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of mee; but not in mention of the cup; <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> omit that paſſage in both, <hi>Paul</hi> addeth it to both, and addeth that in the latter, as oft as yee drinke it. What varietie is here, additions, omiſſions, variations, &amp;c. in the mention of Chriſts laſt commiſſion about the other Sacrament? ſurely, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others will confeſſe, that if it had beene ſo morall, and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, becauſe Chriſts laſt commiſſion, holy men inſpired, would not, had not, could not have ſo placed them, before, or after one another, ſomething before, as mentioned by one, ſomething ſet
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41963:93"/> after the ſame words, by another analogie of faith, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Scriptures with Scriptures, muſt regulate in ſuch things here, and in this Sacramentall order, and ſo in the other.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe ſo much is put in order of phraſe, and words to conclude thence, without compare thereof with other Scriptures; the order of things in acting, becauſe in thoſe two places, ſuch in order of uttering, and expreſſing, I would argue hence. If becauſe beleeving is ſet before baptizing, none is to bee baptized, but ſuch as beleeve, then becauſe being baptized is in the ſame place, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. ſet before being ſaved, therefore no beleevers are ſaved but ſuch as are baptized, and ſo baptiſme is abſolutely neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and a man may bee a true beleever, but for want of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which yet was the caſe of ſome of old which were martyrd, may bee damned: yea then ſince Chriſt when preaching, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 15. ſaying, Repent, and beleeve the Goſpel, it muſt bee concluded it is in the order of things acted, as uttered, that repentance goeth before faith, and that a man actually may repent, before hee actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beleeveth the Goſpel; and ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. If thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth, is placed before the other, if thou ſhalt beleeve with thine heart. <hi>Ergo,</hi> a man may make a ſaving confeſſion of Chriſt, before hee ſavingly beleeve with the heart: yea if the place it ſelfe in <hi>Marke,</hi> muſt bee ſo cloſely ſtuck to, without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the Scriptures of the old Teſtament which were then when <hi>Marke</hi> writ, the onely Scriptures, beſides <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, exiſting, it would follow in the reaſon of perſons then living, that the Goſpel muſt bee preached to Dogs, and Cats, Fowles and Fiſhes, &amp;c. ſince it's expreſly ſaid, Preach to every creature.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I demand of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whether it bee abſurd to ſay the Goſpel is preached to little ones, which underſtand not what is ſaid, if ſo, then what thinkes hee of that ſpeech of Chriſt in the preſence of the little ones which hee uttered concerning them, Of ſuch is the kingdome of God; and, hee that receiveth not the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God as a little child, &amp;c. was this Goſpel, or not? ſurely yes to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> it is ſo which holdeth that Chriſt ſpake it of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in glory it ſelfe: here was then Goſpel preached to little ones, to Infants, yet not abſurdly. Hee dares not ſay that was not Goſpel which <hi>Moſes</hi> on Gods behalfe uttered, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. as hath been ſhewed, yet ſpoken to little ones then preſent, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 14. and that was ſuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. to ſo many as might bee preſent, as well as touching ſo many as were abſent. <hi>Zacharies</hi> ſpeech, ſpoken as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41963:93"/> to his babe <hi>Luke</hi> 1. And thou child ſhalt bee called the Prophet of the moſt high, &amp;c. it was Goſpel preached to a babe.</p>
                     <p>But to come to the core of the objection, as if abſurd to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized unto one knoweth not what; or as others, when one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not the myſteries of ſuch an Evangelicall act and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; I anſwer, <hi>Iſaacs</hi> circumciſion was an Evangelicall ordinance as a ſigne of Gods covenant of grace with him, and to confirme the promiſe of God, to bee a God to him, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to fulfill ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes as <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75. and hee to walk in his father <hi>Abrahams</hi> footſteps, &amp;c. as ſome acknowledge it did ſignifie ſanctification of the ſpirit, juſtification by Chriſts blood, and faith in him as to come, &amp;c. and ſo of an Evangelicall nature, if to any, to him who was the child of promiſe: yet did not hee then underſtand theſe things; did God then in injoyning his circumciſion ſo young injoyne an abſurditie? ſurely no. Chriſts act in bleſſing thoſe Infants, <hi>Marke</hi> 10. and <hi>Luke</hi> 18. as that alſo of his impoſing hands on them, and imbracing them, or taking them into his armes, theſe were no legall, nor ceremoniall, but truely gracious and Evangelicall acts of Chriſt, and very myſterious, yet not abſurd, becauſe they knew not, nor underſtood what hee did for them, in bleſſing of them; <hi>Peter</hi> underſtood not at preſent that Evangelicall act of Chriſt, in waſhing of his feet, yet muſt it bee done, or it had beene worſe for him, <hi>John</hi> 13. 7. 9. 12. will Mr. <hi>B.</hi> challenge this act alſo upon the former grounds to bee abſurd? As for that whim of <hi>I. S.</hi> I ſay wee lay not foundations of building faith upon humane teſtimony more then they of old, in holding out the Doctrine of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Infants circumciſed knew not more that they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in way of an ordinance, then children now doe of their baptiſme, when they come to bee growne up, both ſorts know it as it is teſtified to them by others. Yea but there was a viſible mark to bee ſeene, which is not in baptiſme; grant it ſo, yet how knew they that it was not given them <hi>in ludibrium</hi> by enemies, or unto ſome falſe God, and worſhip, by ſome Idolatrous Prieſts, amongſt whom they might bee as captives, and they could not know that it was adminiſtred to them in a Church way and according to Gods rules but by hear-ſay by friends, or parents? And therefore in the maine of knowing both, as ordinances adminiſtred upon them, they are one.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Diſciples onely, that is beleevers, are to bee baptized, according to <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. the affirmative including the negative,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41963:94"/> therefore not Infants. Let us examine this principle and principall ground worke of our oppoſites.</p>
                     <p>1. Then it ſeemes Scripture Diſciples of Chriſt are onely ſuch beleevers, as <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. ſpeaketh of, and ſuch beleevers onely, as that verſe mentions are to be baptized: which I deny. Firſt, the beleever mentioned, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. is one that ſhall ſurely bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and not condemned, as the oppoſition ſheweth, but neither is every one which is called a Diſciple ſuch a one, witneſſe that, <hi>John</hi> 6. 66. and <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 30. no true beleevers can ſo fatally bee rent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as members cruelly torne from the body, as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſignifieth, they were but externally in the body of Chriſt, not efficaciouſly. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, a Diſciple is in Engliſh a Scholler: yea but all that are Schollers at ſchoole come not to good: nor do they effectually learne what they are taught.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. bee the rule of baptizing, then none are by rule to bee baptized, but ſuch as ſavingly beleeve, for of ſuch a one hee ſpeaketh, in oppoſition to ſuch a one as is damned. And then the Apoſtles which baptized ſo many, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſundry, Chap. 6. 66. proved apoſtates, and came no more at Chriſt, breake rule, as alſo did <hi>John</hi> in baptizing ſundry of the multitude amongſt whom hee knew, were many chaffy hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. but of that more elſe where.</p>
                     <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>B.</hi> challengeth us, to ſhew an Example of one baptized without faith. It's evident many a one was baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch a one, as beleeving, and being baptized ſhould bee ſaved, as <hi>Marke</hi> hath it: many a baptized perſon being never ſaved, as ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of them, <hi>John</hi> 4. and 6. compared; yea if hee meane it of ſome ſpeciall perſonall confeſſing of faith in Chriſt, it was propounded to them as a future thing, which afterwards rather they were to attend, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 4. <hi>John</hi> ſaid to them that they ſhould beleeve in him which was to come after him, and of thoſe ſcribes, and no mention of ſo much as their confeſſing of ſinnes before their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <hi>John</hi> ſharply reproved them, &amp;c. and minded them what they ſhould doe afterward, bring forth fruits of repentance, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 7. 8, 9, 10. and yet hee expreſly ſaith, hee doth baptize them, &amp;c. I indeed, ſaith he, baptize you, &amp;c. but as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urgeth us in that matter of ſhewing any baptized without faith, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith hee is ſilent, ſo ſay I here, the Scripture is ſilent touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Scribes confeſſion of faith, and in <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 15, 16. the Scripture which ſaith <hi>Lydia's</hi> houſhold was baptized; ſaith not that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41963:94"/> any more beleeved but <hi>Lydia;</hi> and becauſe this example is diverſly controverted, I ſhall indeavour to cleare it, as for, and not againſt us, the ſtory is ſo exactly in all the circumſtances of it, ſet downe, that as I wonder of that evaſion, that wee are to ſeeke the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, by that other diſtinct ſtory, as diſtinctly and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſet downe from this, as this from that. The holy Ghoſt is exact in ſetting downe many particular paſſages in mentioning the occaſion of this here expreſſed from <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 6. to 14. and in the particular circumſtances of this paſſage of the firſt ſucceſſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſtery at <hi>Philippi.</hi> The perſon wrought upon is deſcribed: ſhee was no meere Pagan, but a worſhipper of God before, albeit not one that beleeved in Chriſt Jeſus as the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which then was the great article of faith, and full of difficultie to bee beleeved, in all likelihood a Jew, or one of the beſt ſort of proſelytes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing hard for Religions ſake, they were not allowed the libertie of a Synagogue at <hi>Philippi:</hi> as in ſome other places under the <hi>Romiſh</hi> juriſdiction: but they withdrew to a remote place, from ordinary concourſe &amp; view: and though Sabbath ſolemnities were loathſome to the Romans there, yet ſhee, with ſome other women adventure to ſpend the time in Prayer. Thither <hi>Paul</hi> repaires, and amongſt them all ſhee is wrought upon, and no other mentioned: God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her heart that ſhee attended, &amp;c. if any of her houſhould too, had beene then, or preſently after that, brought home to Chriſt; the holy Ghoſt ſo exact in the circumſtances of this ſtory, as in that other afterwards of the Jaylour; it's very unlikely that he would have omitted the ſame here, more then in the other place. Yea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhee and her houſhold were baptized, the Text expreſly ſaith, If yee have judged mee, not if yee have judged them alſo faithfull come into my houſe. If there bee but one ſeeming example for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing, and neither rule nor example to colour that wreſted ſenſe of <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6. that muſt be currant and warrant, for that innovation, and we upbraided, if there were but one example ſo good for Paedobaptiſme, as that for rebaptizing they will yeeld the cauſe to us, and ſo may wee to them, if this bee not fuller for us, then that for them. Yea but ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would you baptize a Turke in his Maſters faith? and what of that? therefore here were none baptized but beleevers unleſſe that bee granted? <hi>Non ſequitur:</hi> is it not rule for us herein to make uſe of a Synecdoche, as well as you, when wee urge you with families baptized, and ſo children in them? you tell us it is a Synecdoche, of the whole put for the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41963:95"/> part: the whole were baptized, that is, the growne part capable of being preached unto in the houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31, 32, 33, 34. Yea but here was none preached to of this houſe that is mentioned but <hi>Lydia</hi> only, yet the houſhold baptized, that is ſay we a part thereof by a Synecdoche, even that part w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> might moſt properly be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in her right more then in their owne, as were her children. For ſo <hi>houſe</hi> in Scripture is oftentimes uſed for children of ſuch, or ſuch a perſon onely, as <hi>Judg</hi> 9. 16. 18. dealing ill with <hi>Gideons</hi> houſe that day, is expounded to bee murdering of his 60. ſonnes: ſo the poore widow, and her houſe, that ſhee was providing for, and which after lived of that meale and oyle, was but the widow and her ſonne, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 12, 13, 15. compared: <hi>Davids</hi> houſe which at that time was not ſo orient, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. was but his children, many whereof proved badly, and came to ſad ends, witneſſe <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaloms, Ammons</hi> act and end, &amp;c. If <hi>Noah</hi> onely beleeving, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, yet all the reſt with him are typically baptized for that ground, Come thou, and thy houſe, even wife, ſonnes, and ſonnes wives, and all into the Arke; For thee, not, for them have I found righteous, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 1. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. if <hi>Abraham</hi> alone bee a beleever, yet hee and his have the ſame ſeale, of the righteouſneſſe of faith of the covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. if the growne <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have faith, it furthers that extraordinary baptiſme in the Sea. Leſſe then this herein is not to bee denied; yea but the rule is plaine otherwiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Marke</hi> 16. therefore the Apoſtles did baptize none, but beleevers and Diſciples: Nay verily by their leave I conclude that that reſtriction of that word Diſciple onely to one, that is an actuall beleever in Chriſt, was never there intended, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. nor was that in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. ever intended to bee a rule of baptizing perſons, excluding every other perſon, then ſuch a one as there is mentioned from being baptized: and I further adde to that; that it pointeth out what a kind of perſon ſhall bee ſaved, rather then bee baptized. Wherefore it is not ſaid, hee that ſhall bee baptized, hee muſt beleeve: but, hee that doth beleeve and is baptized ſhall bee ſaved: hence <hi>contrâ,</hi> hee ſaith not, hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, ſhall not bee baptized, but rather ſhall bee damned, or not ſaved. If children bee excluded from baptiſme, becauſe of the former clauſe, hee that beleeveth, and is baptized, they muſt bee excluded ſalvation, becauſe of the latter clauſe, hee that beleeveth not ſhall bee damned: will not our oppoſites themſelves ſay, that the latter clauſe is taken <hi>de adultis,</hi> and not as any rule of excluſion
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41963:95"/> of Infants from ſalvation; and I ſay as much in that other, as no rule thereby to exclude Infants from baptiſme, it is the ſame in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. if Infants becauſe not beleeving, and effectually called, are excluded the promiſe, then by the ſame reaſon excluded remiſſion of ſins promiſed: yea ſalvation promiſed to them that cal upon God, <hi>v.</hi> 21. &amp; if not therefore excluded theſe, why therefore excluded bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, in defect of actuall faith? if the promiſe of juſtification, &amp; ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be not denied, which are the ſignats for want of actuall faith &amp; repentance, why is baptiſme the ſigne denied them? is the ſigne more then thoſe things ſignified? is not faith and repentance more ſimply required to ſalvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. then to baptiſme? As for what <hi>C. B.</hi> addeth that that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. excludeth Infants: I deny it, if that be taken, as if each baptized perſon had really &amp; effectually put on Chriſt: then none of the <hi>Galatian</hi> members had bin ſuch, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. and 4. 11. 19. 21, 22. and 5. 3, 4, 5. he ſpeakes thus in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſenſe, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. and ſuch like, and ſo each Infant too Sacramentally puts on Chriſt, are buried with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. that is that which is viſibly ſigned and ſealed thereby, and that is the doctrine of the viſible word of the Sacrament, holding forth what baptized perſons are called upon as they are capable to attend: hence the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> is the doctrine thereof: hence the doctrine of baptiſme, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. but ſpecially holding forth what they may expect from God; ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 16. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. circumciſion, called upon them for heart circumciſion, as capable of improving it, and incourageth them what to expect, eſpecially that way from God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26, 27, 28, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As for what <hi>C. B.</hi> addeth touching the rule of baptizing, from <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. albeit the place hath had its diſtinct conſideration, yet I ſhall here adde a word of anſwer to this which is <hi>C. B.</hi> his third argument, that if this bee a rule, then none are to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but ſuch as truely repent. For to no ſeeming, and viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance did <hi>Peter</hi> then exhort them, but to true and ſaving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, all will grant: and then unleſſe wee know mens hearts, and principles, their confeſſion of ſinnes cannot ſatisfie us when wee are to baptize them, as being doubtfull, and not certaine, that the rule is fulfilled in that our act, and wee muſt either doe things doubtfully, and adventure to tranſgreſſe rule, yea oft breake rule, as by this argument <hi>John</hi> did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11, 12. and <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8. Yea but they profeſſed it: ſuppoſe they did, that was not that which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, make confeſſion of or profeſſe your repentance,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41963:96"/> and bee baptized, but repent and be baptized; therefore if that be laid downe as the rule by which men muſt, or elſe muſt not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; hee that is baptized otherwiſe, hee was never regularly baptized, as poſſibly it's the caſe of many in your churches. That which <hi>John Spilsbury</hi> hath this way I find not in the reſt: hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth uſe of <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. as a repeale of the Law of circumciſing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and as the new law of admiſſion, &amp;c. but if that waſhing of water bee meant of baptiſme, it will then bee of as abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to bee externally baptized, as to bee regenerate, both, if ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of two ſeverall things, being made as one in point of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: nor let any ſay that ordinarily it is ſo that none elſe are ſaved: For Chriſts ſerious ſpeaking, yea proteſting, ſhewes hee intends more, yea more then a ſuppoſed neglect, or contempt of baptiſme, but ſimply thus, verily, verily, unleſſe, &amp;c. according to <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. he had to like effect ſpoken, and taking the kingdome here, for a particular viſible Church, not that of glory, which hath no ordinances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. and 13. 8, 9, 10. how ſtands this with his principles, that a man firſt bee diſcipled and inchurched ere baptized, when as rather hee muſt bee from this ground firſt waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, or baptized ere hee can bee in; yea ſo much as ſee a viſible Church, and ſo baptiſme is rather the forme of the Church, then the covenant of grace, as <hi>I. B.</hi> elſewhere affirmeth, and reaſon ſuggeſteth a Church firſt to bee, ere Church ſeales to bee adminiſtred to, or by it: nor need this bee urged in this ſenſe upon <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> as the way of his entrance into Gods kingdome, of a true viſible Church. For of ſuch a Church was hee already a member, even of the Jewes Church: yea if thus meant, then not onely unregenerate perſons ſhould not bee of viſible Churches; but it is not poſſible that they can get into them: for Chriſt ſaith, verily, and unleſſe, &amp;c. hee cannot, no hee ſhould not, or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hee doth not enter into the kingdome of God.</p>
                     <p>As for what was ſaid of preaching the Goſpel, to goe before baptiſme, wee hold it, wee preach it, the doctrine of the covenant is firſt opened, and then ſealed: wee hold forth to parents that Goſpel covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> as to them, and their children, and the Apoſtles did as much, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpel, wherein all ſorts of nationall creatures were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, they held forth that of Gods mind of grace, to that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Infants of Goſpelled Gentiles, and ſo by the Goſpel they as well as the other ſort of adult Gentiles came to partake of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41963:96"/> promiſe, in the initiatory ſeale at leaſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 6. and what Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel they held out in the audible word preached, that they ſealed by the viſible word of baptiſme.</p>

                     <p>Sixtly, to that argument raiſed hence from what is added: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, that is, preſently teaching them, &amp;c. &amp; ſo not Infants, it is not cogent: As much is ſaid in effect of <hi>Abraham</hi> preſently after hee had circumciſed the males in his houſe, and before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne and circumciſed, that hee would command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keepe the way of the Lord: yet none will conclude that therefore, no children of his houſhold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were already circumciſed, and that <hi>Iſaac</hi> and others ſhould not bee circumciſed; in that <hi>Abraham</hi> will take this courſe with all of his family: Are the baptized Gentiles to bee taught the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, that they may doe them? ſo are the proſelyted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons circumciſed, and others alſo circumciſed to bee alſo taught. Yea Infants circumciſed notwithſtanding that part of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, touching ſuch teaching; yea but Infants circumciſed were not capable of teaching: true, nor are ours which are baptized, yet both to bee taught, and ſo are, and were, according as capable thereof; and the Text in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. evinceth, that it is not a preſent teaching them that are there mentioned ſimply, but <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid, ſcil.</hi> according as the baptized perſons were capable of being taught, otherwiſe it muſt bee concluded, that they were preſently to bee all and each of them taught the whole mind of Chriſt, and then it will follow that that could preſently be done,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41963:97"/> by the diſpenſers of the word, which is impoſſible, and likewiſe that the hearers were preſently capable of all points of the doctrine of Chriſt, which is moſt unlikely; Chriſt himſelfe did not take ſuch a courſe with his owne Apoſtles, nor were they capable of it, <hi>John</hi> 16. 12. Yea by the leave of the objectors; ſince they were to hold forth by this ſolemne injunction of Chriſt, whatſoever Chriſt had commanded indefinitely which were not meerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall commands; they muſt amongſt other ſuch commands of his, hold forth the doctrine of his touching the intereſt of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones, of pious minded perſons preſſing after, and priſing of his bleſſing of their children. The kingdome is of ſuch, not meerely of thoſe very perſons, or babes, but of others, of like parents, &amp;c. and his ſolemne command upon that ground of their intereſt in Gods kingdome, that his Apoſtles ſhould not hinder them, but ſuffer the approach of ſuch unto him in any externall way, whereof they are capable, and for which they are fit, as many of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have pleaded thence, that they are for baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, to that argument from the expoſition of baptizing into the name of the Father, &amp;c. <hi>ſcil.</hi> in invocating his name, as <hi>Paul</hi> was bid to doe, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. to this I ſay, if <hi>Paul</hi> was bid to doe ſo, yet doth not that prove that that injunction was ever intended to bee the explication of being baptized into Chriſts name, that is, being baptized ſo, as then perſonally, and actually to call upon his name into which the perſon was baptized; when <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. ſaith, were yee baptized into the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> will it thus bee expounded, that is, when you were baptized, did you call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pauls</hi> name? if any doe ſo, it is new light, as they call it. For I never yet heard of that explication of it, albeit of others; but if that bee the rule that the perſons baptized muſt make their prayers perſonally and particularly to God, when they are baptized: then did thoſe women of <hi>Samaria, Acts</hi> 8. make their perſonall prayers before the publique aſſembly, which I ſuppoſe none will affirme, and if they will not, then the rule of baptiſme was not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Philip,</hi> which were as abſurd, or that was no rule men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: nor was it poſſible that thoſe 3000. baptized in one day, ſhould ariſe each of them, and call upon the name of the Lord as they were baptized. Some would bee longer in prayer, if others would bee ſhort, and who would limit or confine them juſt to ſuch an expence of time, and no more: and if <hi>Peter</hi> would have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled out the time for that end amongſt them, yet he wanted much time, for all and each of them to ariſe, and call thus on Gods name.</p>

                     <p>THe coaſt being thus cleared I may I hope now paſſe on the more freely from interruption to what I intend concerning <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. And firſt I ſay in the generall, the ſtrict of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, I ſay, this had reference in the generall, to the Jewiſh nation, that when as they onely were of the viſible ſchoole, and under the doctrine, &amp; diſcipline of Chriſt the Prophet of his Church as ſpeaking by his ſpirit in their Prophets, and Teachers, and as acting in the Church guides and officers by ſome influence of his authoritie, &amp;c. now not one nation and people, but all nations, the partition wall being broken downe, are to bee called unto the fellowſhip of the promiſe or covenant, and the initiatory ſeale of it; <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 38, 39. not as formerly circumciſion, but baptiſme, not males onely, but without diſtinction of ſexes, not of ſuch a ſtrict day, and age, as eight dayes old, but indefinitely whether elder or younger, but that our oppoſites make bold to goe ſo farre as to ſay, not now, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but onely adult perſons, they were beſt be on better grounds then yet I ſee leſt the rebuke of Chriſt light on them alſo, ſo far forth to hinder the approach of beleevers Infants to him; nor will their rule of beleevers, <hi>Ergo,</hi> onely ſuch, hold; as before we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: or that of the affirmative including the negative; no more then the affirmative, Hee that calls on the name of the Lord ſhall bee ſaved, or, Hee that labours muſt not eate, includeth each its nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that hee which calleth not on Gods name, as no Infant doth, or hee that laboureth not, as no Infant can, ſhall not bee ſaved or eate, and ſo all Infants muſt periſh, and famiſh. And when I ſay it hath reference to the Jewiſh nation, I intend it onely thus far; that looke as none but covenant, and inchurched parents and their children were initiatorily ſealed then by circumciſion, ſo no others are now in ordinary Church adminiſtration to bee baptized then the inchurched parts in and of the nations. Thirdly, I ſay, Chriſt prefacing that ground to this commiſſion, <hi>ſcil.</hi> his ſoveraigne power over not his generall kingdome of the world, but over his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all kingdome of his Church, eſpecially that, which is or ſhall bee in the whole earth; hee intendeth the execution of this commiſſion

                     <p>THeſe things premiſed, whereas Anabaptiſts doe affirme, that no Infants but adult perſons onely are to bee baptized accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any rule of Chriſt; I ſay that that ſort of perſons, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Infants of inchurched beleevers are to bee baptized, as well as that ſort of perſons, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Adult perſons making perſonall and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular profeſſion and confeſſion of their faith, &amp;c. and that from the force of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20.

                     <p>Secondly, taken from the nature of the commiſſion, <hi>ſcil.</hi> a charge of Church diſpenſation of the Goſpel, or diſpenſing of it with Church reference, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 15. it is Goſpel they are to preach, and this being Goſpel, that children of inchurched covenant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, were to bee with them alſo taken into the fellowſhip of the covenant, and people of God, externally intereſted in it, as was proved before: and the initiatory ſcale being a branch of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as well as the promiſe, as baptiſme is reckoned, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 34. 5, 6. compared with <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3, 4. ſuch Infants federall intereſt in the Church, and initiatory Church ſeale muſt needs bee inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, from the latitude of the Church reference to which this commiſſion relateth, albeit with ſome different reſpects had to thoſe times and ages following, according as then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were extraordinary, and Apoſtolicall, and thoſe ſucceeding were to bee ordinary Paſtours, Teachers: and withall with various reſpects had to the firſt foundation, members ſtrictly conſidered, as ſuch, and others: now that latitude it appeares was ſuch, as tooke in all the viſible Churches throughout the world, unto the worlds end: From which if ſuch Infants bee excluded, an actuall and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged intereſt, they are excluded, as was proved in ordinary courſe from ſalvation: there being ordinarily none ſaved, but ſuch as are in the viſible Church, or ſome viſible Churches in the world. And if not excluded an actuall intereſt in ſome viſible Church or other, in the earth; why are they excluded baptiſme which is here given to diſtinguiſh the inchurched parts of the world, from all other, as well as to ratifie and ſeale up the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them; there is no time ſet now to limit them to ſuch a day as of old to the eighth, that that ſhould ſuſpend their <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> which they had as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, ſo ſoone as borne, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elicited till the injoyned day.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, from that latitude of the nation diſciple which taketh in ſuch Infants as well as others, and conſequently they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the commiſſion of being baptized: For Diſciples are to be baptized, as our oppoſites confeſſe. For proofe of their diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I argue thus. All thoſe to whom the thing ſignified by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple as explained in any place of Scripture, is appliable, they are Scipture Diſciples: but the former is true of ſuch Infants, <hi>ergo</hi> the latter.

Yea if the latitude of the ſignification of a Scripture diſciple, muſt all meet in one, to make a compleat definition: then Diſciples muſt bee Apoſtles, becauſe ſome were ſo called which were ſuch. The names of the 12. Diſciples, <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. 1. and the names of the 12. Apoſtles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. are one, ſee more, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 16. The eleven Diſciples, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Apoſtles. It is then enough to attribute that name Diſciple to any, to whom the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and explication of that name, any where in Scripture mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is by the Spirit of God applyed: wee neede not feare to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41963:100"/> ſuch a leader, and ſpeake after him, the minor then is to bee proved; that ſuch a ſignified thing by that name Diſciple is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch little ones mentioned. For proofe hereof I muſt take up that wherein I perceive I am prevented by others; yet ſhall not deſiſt to ſpeake the ſame thing in ſubſtance with them; one to whom drinke or water is given, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 42. in the name of a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is expounded by the Spirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 41. to be one, to whom it is given in the name of one belonging to Chriſt. Whence I argue. All ſuch as belong to Chriſt externally, they are externally his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples: ſuch Infants mentioned, belong to Chriſt externally: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are externally Chriſts Diſciples. And the ſame deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Diſciple which ſhall bee ſaved holds thus, ſuch as ſavingly belong to Chriſt are Diſciples which ſhall bee ſaved; but it's not needfull to goe ſo farre in this caſe: To the ſaving intereſt and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Baptiſme, it is required that one ſavingly belong to Chriſt, and bee a Diſciple ſavingly in that ſenſe: but to the externall and Church intereſt in the uſe of the ſeale, it's not of neceſſitie, for then none ought to bee baptized, but ſuch as are in a ſaving eſtate, which to us is a ſecret, and ſo no ordinary proceeding in mans Court; yea the very place ſpeakes of the caſe: as one that giveth drinke to another, becauſe to him and in his judgement, hee is a Diſciple; for infallibly hee doth not know him, but taketh him rather to bee ſuch a one; and therefore refreſheth him. The major therefore of the Syllogiſme is in ſubſtance the very Text, the minor is evident, ſuch as externally belong to the Church of which Chriſt is the the head, they doe externally belong to Chriſt, &amp;c. hence to bee in his Church by externall profeſſion and to bee in him, are put for one, <hi>John</hi> 15. 2 now that ſuch Infants belong to that Church wee formerly proved, in proving both that they belonged to Chriſts viſible Church and kingdome, and that he was head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> frameth two anſwers to a like objection hence, his firſt wee have already diſproved, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that Infants alſo belong to Chriſt in reſpect of viſible and Church conſtitution, which hee denyeth. His ſecond is as impertinent, hee ſaith Chriſt ſpeakes in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> of Adult perſons: true: I never intended to urge it otherwiſe; but my argument runs, that the ſignification and reaſon of the name of Diſciple there given, though to growne perſons, yet ſince what is there in that Scripture applied to ſuch; is alſo appliable to ſuch Infants alſo, therefore they are Scripture Diſciples. So <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. the name Diſciples and Chriſtians are

Diſcipled perſons in the Text as in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to baptizing, implyeth perſons externally in the Covenant of grace, unleſſe our oppoſites thinke other then ſuch ſhould bee baptized. Alſo perſons in the viſible Church are baptized, unleſſe they thinke perſons out of any viſible Church fellowſhip may bee in ordinary diſpenſation baptized: for which extraordinary calls and caſes our times meddle not, nor have not, as of old there were ſome, which yet impeach not our rule of the Church ſeales given to the Church, for her uſe and by her preaching Elders to bee diſpenſed; he then is diſcipled for Baptiſme, which is inchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, which is in the Schoole of Chriſt and in peculiar fellowſhip with the other Schollers there, and in ſpeciall relation to Chriſt the Teacher of his Church; yea ſuch as to whom in ſome ſenſe hee preacheth Goſpell, as to thoſe Babes in <hi>Luke;</hi> and howſoever hee teacheth the loweſt formes, as I may call them, that ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his Church, that is ſome ſuch, he ſo promiſeth to teach them inwardly, that hee doth ſo appeare in ſaved Church children; yea ſo hee may teach Indian Papouſes now too. I anſwer, if wee ſpeake of his abſolute power, hee can doe more then he ever will, as to make many other worlds, &amp;c. but to ſpeake of his ordinate and regulate power, ſo hee can doe but what hee willeth to doe, what his ſecret will is, not for us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. but according to his revealed will, wee may ſay that thoſe children being eſtranged actually from the Covenant and Church they are actually without God and Chriſt, and hope, but beleevers Infants externall eſtate is eccleſiaſtically of another nature. So much for clearing <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and confirmation of Paedobaptiſme thence.</p>

                     <p>A Second Argument is this. All thoſe which are the Church ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> they are to bee baptized. Infants of inchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched beleevers are the Church ſeed of <hi>Abraham, ergo</hi> are to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. The major is not denied I thinke by our oppoſites; but if it bee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 17. 27, 28, 29. proveth that all ſuch were baptized in Apoſtolicall Churches, and therefore are to bee in ours. The
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41963:101"/> minor hath beene formerly proved in the concluſions touching fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall intereſt, and is evident by the Apoſtles argument: if Chriſts, then <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. Whence I argue, All ſuch as are Chriſts or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt, they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: Such Infants belong to Chriſt, <hi>ergo,</hi> they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. The Major is true both waies, ſuch as ſavingly and efficaciouſly belong to Chriſt, they are ſo farre alſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> elect ſeed, ſuch as eccleſiaſtically are Chriſts, in which ſenſe the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of it, as hath been proved, they are ſo farre alſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church ſeed. The Minor is true of the ſpecies of ſuch Infants, if taken in an efficacious way of ſaving intereſt: that ſort of perſons as well as the other of adult perſons are ſuch; elſe none of them could ever bee ſaved: unleſſe ſome are ſaved which neither belong to Chriſt nor are elect; either of which would bee abſurd to affirme, but that is a ſecret, wee are to looke to viſibilitie thereof as the rule of diſpenſation of Church ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If therefore taken in an eccleſiaſticall ſenſe as here it is, as was proved, ſo all ſuch Infants doe belong to Chriſt as hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and conſequently are eccleſiaſtically <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church ſeed.</p>

                     <p>A Third argument is taken from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. thus. Thoſe to whom appertaineth any principall ground upon which any of the Apoſtles have moved and encouraged growne ones to bee baptized, they are according to Apoſtolicall encouragement vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually given to bee baptized. But to the Infants mentioned doth appertaine the forenamed ground, therefore there is virtually an Apoſtolicall encouragement for them alſo to bee baptized. The Major is undeniable, unleſſe any ſuppoſe that any of the Apoſtles as Apoſtles, as here <hi>Peter</hi> is conſidered, ſhould give an inſufficient ground to any thing unto which they encouraged others. For to give a chiefe ground of encouraging and putting any upon this or that which will not univerſally hold where the ſame ground was to bee found, it is to give an inſufficient ground. If a Paſtor mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially urge a member thus, Brother looke you, watch over your brethren, &amp;c. for you are a brother, if this bee not cogent with any other brother as a brother unto the like watch, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient principle and groundworke, ſo here in the caſe mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, none will doubt but it was a ſufficient groundworke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the former as a dutie <hi>ſcil.</hi> their repentance to whom hee ſpake; and why not of the like force in the other? yea and ſo you will
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41963:102"/> ſay it is where both are joyned. Nay verily it muſt bee of force, if ſufficient, to enforce either apart: if both bee diſtinct duties as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will evince, and this be the common enforcing reaſon to both, it muſt hold as well in either of them conſidered apart, as in both of them joyntly taken. And I would know if the Apoſtle had from ſuch a ground of the promiſe urged one already baptized to repent onely, had it not beene ſufficient? or ſuppoſe hee had to deale with one that in his judgement had repented already: urging him onely to bee baptized, becauſe the promiſe belonged to him, had not this been of ſufficient force thereunto? no rationall perſon I thinke will deny it. The minor will appeare by declaring the groundwork upon which the Apoſtle urged them to bee baptized. Now this was the onely ground upon which <hi>Peter</hi> urged them as to the former dutie of repenting, ſo to the later of being baptized: For the promiſe is, or belongs to you, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the promiſe of grace, of remiſſion of ſinnes, &amp;c. as before was cleared. Yea but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is called ſo too from them on this ground, and that Infants are not capable of; To this wee have formerly anſwered, why it was meete to require as we doe, ſome teſtimony of repentance in offenſive members of a corrupt Church, albeit a true viſible Church as was that of the Jewes, if they will bee fixed members of purer Churches, as was that Church of Chriſtians, <hi>verſ</hi> 41. and as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof partake of the ſeales; yet wee doe not expect the ſame of their children too, under no ſuch actuall ſcandall, but baptize them in their confeſſing parents right alſo. Beſides it appeareth before that it was a ſufficient ground on which to urge the baptiſme of ſuch or ſuch a perſon as conſidered in it ſelfe apart.</p>
                     <p>Now that the groundworke, <hi>ſcil.</hi> intereſt externall at leaſt, was that intereſt of thoſe perſons not yet ſavingly wrought upon in the promiſe of grace that appertaineth to ſuch Infants of inchurched and externally covenant parents, it appeareth in this very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the perſons ſpoken to were members of that true viſible Church of the Jewes viſibly in the covenant as wee proved; the perſons ſpoken of alſo were their owne naturall children, as was likewiſe proved, and of them alſo <hi>Peter</hi> avoweth even after Chriſts aſcenſion, and in reference to participation in the ſeale of baptiſme in a Church of Chriſtians: That the promiſe [is to your children] ſo that the concluſion followeth that the baptiſme of ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is virtually called upon as well as of adult perſons.</p>

                     <p>No, will ſome ſay, but it is not. For they that gladly received the word, ſaith the Text, were baptized, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. And they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and prayers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. and 44.

And what then? therefore other things there mentioned were not ſo too? <hi>non ſequitur;</hi> what more uſuall in Scripture then to ſpeake of things in a collective way of perſons which are not all and each of them appliable to all and each particular perſon of that company, but by a Synecdoche ſome things are ſpoken of the whole wholly, but others are onely appliable to ſome parts of that whole. It's ſaid in this place all that beleeved were together, and had all thing common, and ſold their poſſeſſions, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44, 45. will any take this of the whole company in all the parts of it? all were not capable of ſuch an act applied to all, as not all having poſſeſſions to ſell, for ſome were in need rather of ſupply from others, <hi>verſ.</hi> 45. It is therefore a Synecdoche ſo in the other, ſo all are ſaid to continue in the Apoſtles doctrine and prayers, &amp;c. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Infants were not capable of, and therein it is as in the other Synecdochicall, for of other things mentioned they were capable, and they were appliable to them, they had things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon too, and had ſupplies of clothing or food, &amp;c. according to their need; unleſſe any will ſay, that theſe perſons ſpoken of had no children needing ſuch ſupplies as well as themſelves, or elſe if they had, yet their needs were not ſupplied, ſo when they all eate their meate in ſeverall houſes, &amp;c. what were the children ſhut out of doores if they had any, or had none of thoſe families any children in them? Suppoſe they could not eate meate with ſuch ſingleneſſe of heart, yet were they not of them that did eate their meate and were refreſhed with them: there were doubtleſſe ſome hypocrites in heart amongſt them, and they could not eate with them with a ſingle heart, but were rather ſpots in their feaſts of charitie, as <hi>Judes</hi> phraſe is, <hi>Jude</hi> 12. yet by a Synecdoche, all did eate with heart ſingleneſſe, in that ſome which were capable of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41963:103"/> act doing, did ſo among them, all added were ſuch as ſhould bee ſaved too by a Synecdoche, and in a Church ſenſe; yea their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſome of them were ſuch really, and all of them in an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and eccleſiaſticall reſpect of covenant and Church intereſt: they were capable of that adjunct, albeit not of ſome others, ſo were they capable of being added to the viſible Church of Chriſtians, as they were of that true viſible Church of the Jewes before. And as all the Infants of covenant and inchurched Parents which ſtand right in the Church, are alſo in that right inchoatively members of that Church, albeit not perfectly. And inchoative actuall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip of a true viſible Church, doth externally inright to the initiatory Church and Covenant ſeale of baptiſme; of which two theſe members children were enrighted, as well as others then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And for further clearing of this way of application of ſome common acts to an aſſembly where are children, which are not appliable to the whole company, wholly, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 5. bringing on the Apoſtle and his company is appliable to all thoſe of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> men, women and children, but that act of praying not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appliable to the little ones, but rather to the growne perſons preſent. Weeping and ſwearing is applyed to the whole company aſſembled, whereof many were children, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 1. 5. compared, yet proper to the growne part; albeit the other of being aſſembled before the houſe of God, &amp;c. were common, as that ſinne confeſſed on the behalfe of the whole aſſembly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. was underſtood of the whole figuratively.

Dens</hi> notion holds not concerning God being in a ſenſe in covenant with Infants, but they may not bee ſaid to enter into covenant with him, that by the way. To returne to that in hand; nations baptized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. are to bee taught to obſerve Chriſts comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, but <hi>non ſequitur</hi> that Infants are no part of the Churches in the nation to bee baptized; ſo here, Infants beleeve not actually, &amp;c. <hi>non ſequitur, ergo,</hi> not to bee added to the Church in a ſolemne way of initiation to Church eſtate inchoatively by externall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Both may ſtand together and have their truth of the whole in ſome things wholly, wherein they are capable as of Church eſtate and baptiſme, in others true of the whole in reſpect of ſome part thereof as actuall beleeving. To like purpoſe <hi>C. B.</hi> argueth weakely in his ſixth argument, that the whole citie was baptized men and women mentioned, not their children too, as if therefore excluded; I may as well argue from <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 11, 12. That thoſe Kings tooke all the goods of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Lot, ergo,</hi> they tooke no people beſides contrary to <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. or if they did take people and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41963:104"/> women, yet not children too. And if <hi>Lot</hi> were firſt taken and then redeemed by <hi>Abraham</hi> with others, yet not <hi>ergo</hi> his children or daughters, or if then under the notion of women, yet not a word of children, wherefore either they were left behind in the Citie without their Parents when they were taken, or if taken with the Cities and perſons, yet not brought backe againe, which would bee abſurd to affirme.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe the beleeving Jewes children were not juſt at that time baptized, when their Parents were thus ſolemnly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Church of Chriſtians, yet <hi>non ſequitur</hi> that they were not baptized afterwards. When members are ſolemnly admitted to compleat and fixed memberſhip in our Churches, wee baptize not oft times their little ones the firſt day of that their admittance, yet doe it afterwards as occaſion is offered, and their deſire thereof ſignified.</p>

                     <p>YEa but neither then nor in any other Text in the <hi>Acts</hi> is it ever mentioned, that any children of any beleeving Jewes were baptized. A. <hi>Non ſequitur</hi> that therefore they were never baptized. Many things of great weight were done by Chriſt, and ſo by his Apoſtles which were not recorded: yet not therefore never acted by them, <hi>John</hi> 20. 30, 31. of which ſee more before touching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of Scripture. But doe our oppoſites indeed conclude, that none of the beleeving Jewes children were ever baptized by Apoſtolicall approbation? Is it imaginable that among ſo many thouſand beleeving Jewes, at leaſt eccleſiaſtically, ſuch which are ſo moved and touched in the caſe of their childrens being not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and ſealed that way to the covenant, that it would not much more ſtartle them to ſuppoſe ſuch a tenet or practiſe as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to bee ſealed any way by initiatory ſealing at all, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by circumciſion, ſo not by baptiſme.

                     <p>A Fourth argument followeth, <hi>ſcil.</hi> In that the Infants of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant inchurched parents which were externally intereſted in the covenant of grace, as inveſted with the covenant of a politicall viſible Church, to whom the Seales were appointed, they were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as they were in bodily reſpect capable to bee ſealed in that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory way of circumciſing, therefore Infants now according to their capacitie in bodily reſpects of the like initiatory appointed ſeale, are to bee ſealed in the initiatory way of baptizing. For clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer proceeding in the argument, I ſhall lay downe a few propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41963:105"/> Firſt, that the old teſtament is avowed by the holy Ghoſt in the new, to containe all things neceſſary for faith and practiſe for ſubſtance; and that ſo fully, that a miniſter of the Goſpell, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary, might bee furniſhed thence with ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke and generall rules, upon and according to which to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in holding forth any thing neceſſary to bee beleeved, or practiſed. Of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament is that full teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15. See <hi>Cartwright in locum,</hi> ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. 31. Secondly, that the Apoſtles in all other things uſed to hold forth Goſpel ſervices with analogy to legall Types, Rites, and Sacrifices, &amp;c. teſtimonies are plentifull for it. Thirdly, that it was the Apoſtles uſe to hold forth and confirme things of moſt weight from the old Teſtament, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. from the 14. to 41. and 3. 22. to the end, and 4. 10, 11. 24. to 29. and 8. 12. 25. 35, 36. compared with <hi>Eſay</hi> 52. 15. and 53. 1, &amp;c. So <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 38, 39. old Teſtament grounds, yea from the promiſe are given them for baptiſme it ſelf in the new; yea for the diſpenſation of all the Goſpel ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unto the Gentiles, as thereof capable, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46, 47, 48, &amp;c. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they had no ground, or if any, they urged them not, which is contrary to thoſe places, or if any, they urged them from the old Teſtament then onely extant, to eſtabliſh their practiſes. Fourthly, that Chriſt himſelfe gave them patterne in this way of proofe. Fiftly, that the people with whom they had firſtly to doe, were beleeving Jewes in that way, and they were zealous for the old Teſtament in the generall. Sixtly, that the ancients of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches have rarely, if at all denyed the comming of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in circumciſions ſtead. Seventhly, that where a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God doth injoyne any one thing upon ſuch a ground, there the command doth require all things w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>h are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as helpefull to the ſame thing; as the Commandement, Thou ſhalt not kill, forbids anger alſo as tending to the ſame end, <hi>ſcil,</hi> to murder, and as well forbidding ſtriking, raſh ſpeaking, &amp;c. on the ſame ground, as tending to murder: yea but Chriſt expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it. Anſwer, Chriſt doth not put any thing thus upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which was not virtually in it before; hee urged it, but not legiſlatively, as then making a law in ſuch particulars; but, declaratively, as expounding that law and reducing particulars to their generall heads of commandment. Yea but there was his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof in that reducing: True, but when explained, yet ſo as things in the commands before, onely then clearely underſtood to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41963:105"/> be ſo; ſo here, looke as God commanding <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſion in the fleſh for that end and on that ground, that it might be an initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſeale or Sacramentall ſigne of the covenant, ſo alſo in the ſame doth hee virtually command baptiſme with water, as being of the ſame nature, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſuch as fulfilleth that end, <hi>ſcil.</hi> initiatorily to ſeale the covenant, therefore albeit circumciſion ceaſe, yet the commandement thereof reacheth and partly authoriſeth that baptiſme in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to Infants for that end, as of old to thoſe Infants for that end. Baptiſme is a ſigne I ſay of the covenant, and therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall, and then any waſhing uninſtituted had ſufficed this way, but that ſuch waſhing of water ſhould bee that ſigne needed an inſtitution, and being inſtituted, it is now of the old uſe to ſeale initiatorily the covenant to adult or Infant externally initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it. Yea but Chriſts inſtitution gave a riſe both to the ſigne that baptiſme ſhould bee that, and that ſuch and ſuch perſons ſhould be ſigned with it, therefore not the command of circumciſion gave riſe ſo much as to the application of that ſigne, to ſuch or ſuch perſons. Anſwer: it followeth not, that Chriſts inſtitution gave warrant therein, therefore not the commandment of circumciſion, ſince both conſent in the maine ground of both, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that wee ſhall apply our ſelves to the uſe of ſuch ſignes as hee ſhall appoint, and that in both ſhould bee the ſame moralls or ſpiritualls ſignified, the Lord knowing that wee needed ſome ſolemne externall way of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of his mind of grace, by ſome ſigne, as well as they did. Eighthly, as none may adde to, ſo neither may any detract from any words of Gods grace, wherein hee hath expreſſed himſelfe, unleſſe hee himſelfe repeale the ſame: hee once would have his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace to bee to the whole Church and Church ſeed, and once would have it initiatorily ſealed on them; hee hath repealed the way of ſealing, but the covenant hee hath not, the extent of it to parent and child hee hath not, the ordinary diſpenſation of it in, and from, and by the viſible Church hee hath not: the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling uſe of an initiatory covenant and Church ſeale hee hath not: the things mainely to bee ſealed even covenant and Church right. at leaſt externall and the like, both of inchurched covenant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children, hee hath not, as in former concluſions hath been ſhewed.</p>

It's anſwered in the generall, <hi>v.</hi> 10. they are compleat in Chriſt; how? as fulfilling the types which were in any Jewiſh ceremonies onely? no verily, not onely ſo; albeit firſtly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſo; for Chriſt nailed them on his croſſe, and tooke them away, as ſuch, by his death. And what need then any Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances at all? wee have all in Chriſt might ſome ſay, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. I am for Chriſt, I care not for <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Apollos,</hi> nor <hi>Cephas,</hi> nor for their diſpenſation of the word or ſeale of the covenant, I have enough in Chriſt; ſuch a ſpawne of our ſeekers there was in thoſe times, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Yea but the Lord Jeſus in wiſedome and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe will have his Church and people to bee graced and perfect as of old they were in ſubſtantialls of the ſame Church ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the like. The beautie of the Church was perfect through that Church comelineſſe, which God did in this reſpect put upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 14. not a comelineſſe of outward poſſeſſions, in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall land, in temporall juriſdictions, kingdomes, cities: what had the Church, <hi>quà</hi> Church, and as in covenant with God, as his covenant Spouſe, to doe with them? nay the heathen might vye with them, for as good land, as large poſſeſſions, territories, riches, honours, dominions, &amp;c. yea but not for Church ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; hee dealt not ſo with any nation beſides, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. Chriſt had as mediator and as a Prieſt compleated all ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41963:106"/> types: yea, but as Prophet hee will have it held forth and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that diſpenſation of the Goſpel, and as King of the Church hee will have all alſo exhibited in ſuch a way, and by ſuch evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall meanes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. the Word and the Seales, they are parts of the Goſpel in the diſpenſation of them and by them all is brought to light: yea by them as by pipes is Chriſts fulneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed as head of his viſible body the Church outwardly, as it is by his ſpirit to his elect inwardly, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. hence the Church hath ſuch officers given it, whoſe proper work it is to exhibit and communicate ſuch things as tend to make them every way compleat, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. wee are compleat in Chriſt, as the <hi>ſignatum,</hi> but yet in baptiſme too as the ſigne. Yea but regeneration and ſanctification, both in reſpect of mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and quickning grace, &amp;c. ſignified by circumciſion, is conferred on us by Chriſt. And ſo it was of old in him, in whom, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26, 27. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. was yea, and amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. and by his Spirit as hee held all forth then in the miniſtry of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. ſo hee exhibited the ſame to his elect among them; yet then hee had covenant and Church Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols to confirme the ſame and inſtrumentally to convey the ſame, and ſo now, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26. As by the word of covenant, as the principall inſtrument, and the Spirit maketh baptiſme it ſelfe to become efficacious: ſo by waſhing too hee ſanctifyeth his Church both as that whereby hee ratifyeth it ſo to their faith that they have the more ſtrength of hold and influence for that end; and as that which he bleſſeth as one ordinary meane alſo, in reſpect of the word of promiſe; to which baptiſmall waſhing is annexed as the Seale. Sanctifying and purging is the <hi>ſignatum</hi> and end: waſhing with water through the word, is the ordinary Seale, and meane; whence here, in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. when hee had laid downe that <hi>theſis,</hi> he declareth it by two inſtances: partly in that wee are circumciſed by the circumciſion of Chriſt, which is the fulfilling of the type, <hi>v.</hi> 11. partly by applying the benefits of the circumciſion of Chriſt, to them and theirs, by the like, or an equall ordinance to that of circumciſion which the Jewes injoyed, to wit, of baptiſme; elſe were not the Church and Saints now as compleat as thoſe of old; which as they had virtually all fulfilled in Chriſt to their faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 11. and 26. 6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. So had they withall ſealing ordinances, applying the ſpirituall circumciſion of Chriſt to them and theirs. And ſo <hi>Aretius,</hi> which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41963:107"/> maketh Chriſt the perfect organon of our ſalvation, without any other equall externall cauſe joyned with him, in that reſpect it was by him alone, that all was fulfilled, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19, 20. and by himſelfe he did that worke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. yet in point of externall application, hee denieth not any thing wee ſay; for in the ſame place in his notes upon <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. within foure or five lines, hee addeth it as an obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing from the place, that baptiſme comes in the ſtead of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as is evident in that the Apoſtle calleth it the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt; <hi>ſcil.</hi> in a Sacramentall way: under the name of the ſigne in whoſe ſtead baptiſme is ſet, comprehending the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thing ſignified by a metonymy, as the covenant, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall ſigne of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 8. the teſtament, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the viſible ſeale of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. So his body and blood, <hi>ibid.</hi> the Sacramentall communion of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it in a Sacramentall ſenſe. So that the Apoſtles anſwer is full to prove the uſeleſneſſe of circumciſion, which the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would have intruded upon them as neceſſary to the Gentile Churches, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9. and 4. 21. and 5. 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24, &amp; 24. 25. It was a generall falſe doctrine troubling all the Gentile Churches, <hi>ibid.</hi> but it's now uſeleſſe in reſpect of the maine thing ſignified, Chriſt to come, who hath fulfilled it as ceremonious and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the externall ſigne, and meane of application of Chriſt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> circumciſion ſupplied by baptiſme: whence Gentile <hi>Philippians</hi> as well as <hi>Paul</hi> a Jew are of the circumciſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were inwardly circumciſed, ſo are they at leaſt ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtically judged to bee, they were externally circumciſed: ſo are they in their baptiſme, <hi>ergo,</hi> now circumciſion is wholly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Yea but what is this to Infants? the Apoſtle directs his ſpeech to growne ones: Suppoſe he did, yet this ſpeech is of, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to their children as well. Elſe therein had they not beene ſo compleat, as thoſe formerly which had a covenant made with, and externally ſealed both to them and theirs: yea the ſealing of the covenant, as wee have ſhewed, by baptizing of ſuch as have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is not ſo compleat in ordinary diſpenſations, unleſſe as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered the ſame bee ſealed initiatorily on their children, according to their outward capacitie of the externall ſigne. The whole covenant is as well ſealed on <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, as on himſelfe, and not wholly ſealed on either, without other, as not wholly made with the parent, but with reſpect to the other. It were elſe to cut off a great part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church ſeed, &amp; ſo make Church
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41963:107"/> parents more imperfect, but eſpecially unto the falſe teachers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the anſwer was not elſe ſo full. Be it that Chriſt is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype of circumciſion now: So hee was to the faith of them of old. Bee it that Gentiles are inwardly circumciſed, ſo were they of old: yea bee it that inchurched parents are externally circumciſed in their externall baptiſme actually, and ſo circumciſion is ſo far uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to that ſort of growne perſons: yet what is this to the other ſort of perſons, which uſed, yea they moſtly, to bee circumciſed; and it was their parents dutie to indeavour their circumciſion as well as their owne. If now there bee no ſuch perſons to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally circumciſed alſo in baptiſme, and that their parents are under no tie in that reſpect, then at leaſt circumciſion in reſpect of them may bee uſefull and neceſſary, there being no initiatory ſigne appointed for them. To ſay they have the internall circumciſion, our oppoſites will deny, and if they have had ſundry elect Infants of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed of old. To ſay they are antitypically circumciſed in Chriſt, our oppoſites will not affirme of all the Churches chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches children, and if onely of ſome, as much was virtually in Chriſt to come for the elect Jewiſh babes, yea for thoſe parents and children belonging to grace before ever circumciſion was of uſe; to ſay they are externally circumciſed in their parents baptiſme, as much might have been ſaid that way if rightly ſaid of the Jewiſh children in their parents circumciſion: yet they were actually cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſed alſo. The Apoſtle argueth of a compleatneſſe in Chriſt with reference to baptiſme, which is therefore here named, as an outward meane whereby inchurched Gentiles, eſpecially, come or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to have communion with Chriſt, and to bee compleat in him, yea and as an outward way of holding forth manifeſting, and proving the uſeleſneſſe of circumciſion to them, for it is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to circumciſion teachers as Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> rightly hath it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe therefore our oppoſites will exclude them all Church intereſt contrary to what wee have proved: or that they would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers children denied of one initiatory outward meane of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, whence that of baptizing into his name; (or covenant followſhip) unleſſe alſo they would have us want one Apoſtolicall way of arguing to prove the uſeleſneſſe of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all ſorts of perſons, which uſed perſonally to bee circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed of old, or unleſſe they will deny that baptiſme is of the ſame ſpirituall uſe, as circumciſion was, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to bee a Sacramentall ſigne, or ſeale of the covenant, and the viſible intereſt of perſons in it;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41963:108"/> which <hi>Hen. Den</hi> denyeth, but others doe not, and if they doe wee have formerly proved the contrary, I ſee not how the force of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. will bee avoided in this point of Paedobaptiſme.</p>

                     <p>VVHereas therefore divers things are brought to invalidate any binding reference to circumciſion, if it bee intended of any type to the ſubſtantialls of it, and in it, or any forcible ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in divers materiall things deduced thence, wee deny the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of ſuch arguments, as when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us of a many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betweene baptiſme and circumciſion, and ſo <hi>I. S.</hi> the like, and <hi>Hen. Den</hi> the like, it will not thence follow, <hi>ergo,</hi> in nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtill, that one as the other is a ſeale of the covenant, that one as the other diſtinguiſheth the viſible members of the Church from Pagans: and this followeth not, and wee aſſay not to make the proportion runne of foure feet, as the proverbe is, nor to prove proportion in ſundry circumſtantialls, peculiar to that ordinance. It ſufficeth us that they agree in their common author, Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall nature and end. They are both inſtitutions of God, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall initiatory ſignes in their natures, to bee applied to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ſorts, as they are outwardly capable thereof, which are viſibly intereſted in covenant, &amp;c. albeit in their particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of adminiſtration, and the circumſtances of time, place, ſex, nation, member of the body, &amp;c. they differ; ſucceſſors are not ſucceſſors if every way the ſame if no way different; yet I would not create differences as ſome do, which never were. As firſt, that the circumciſed Babes did eate the Paſſeover: when yet the Law to all that came thither, ſtrangers or <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was one, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to keepe it to the Lord, with ſpirituall reſpects to Gods ends and rules, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49. to bee in heart prepared as well as to bee cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially cleane, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19, 20. the children in that family celebration of it, asked not what meane [wee] by this ſervice, as if they actually partooke thereof, but what meane [yee] by it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 26. or if ſuch children capable of inſtruction, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as ſome authors have thought, yet not Babes which could not goe up to the Temple, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 16, 17. Nor doth the mention of the houſe, or congregation, which ſome who will not allow us that latitude of like plea urge, as keeping it, evince it; but is an uſuall Synecdoche: ſuch roſt, parched meate and ſoure hearbes, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. were too harſh to goe downe with ſuch Babes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 3.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41963:108"/> they in the Wilderneſſe kept the paſſeover according to all the rites of it, yet none will ſay the uncircumciſed males therein; for circumciſion was not uſed in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. did eate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to expreſſe rule, no uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eate. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that circumciſion ſealed <hi>Canaan,</hi> as if that were all Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. 11. 13. but of this formerly. Or thirdly, that reprobates as well as elect were then ſealed, as if none but elect are now ſealed: as for <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> in what ſenſe they by extraordinary revelation to this or that perſon being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and yet after ſealed, how it might bee and was, as was that of <hi>Judas</hi> to Chriſt adminiſtring the Supper and ſop, a knowne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, yet admitted, &amp;c. and no croſſing of ordinary rule; we formerly ſpake to it. Fourthly, circumciſion bound, ſay ſome, to the law; What, not I hope in the rigour of it, and as the ſubſtance of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of workes made with <hi>Adam?</hi> was <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi> bound thus thereby, and not rather to it as to an holy rule of life? and ſo are wee, yea by our baptiſme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. if any will Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize circumciſion or baptiſme to make it <hi>ex opere operato</hi> availeable to ſalvation, they then legalize it, and if that way they looke for life, they muſt keepe the whole Law, or elſe they periſh.

S.</hi> It brought them into covenant; when it confirmed rather a precedaneous right in both, and ſeales of God uſe not to bee appointed to bee put to blankes but to the covenant, and that was with Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as before. Whence that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 8. 11. nor was this any meere outward covenant ſealed, but the very covenant of ſaving grace (as ſome expreſſe it) even that, I will bee a God to them, or as <hi>I.

Yea all ſorts were thereby bound to, and called upon to indeavour after faith in Chriſt, a new heart, power of godlineſſe, &amp;c. hence <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 16. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. 29. and 3. 30. Nor doth circumciſion as it was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> belong to another covenant, but as it was given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Levit.</hi> 12. 3. betweene which Chriſt diſtinguiſheth, <hi>John</hi> 7. 22.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41963:109"/> Nor doth the father of the families hand in circumciſion, when as now it is the miniſter of the Goſpell which baptizeth, argue that baptiſme belongs to another Prieſthood: as long as both of them belonged; that to the ordinary appointed Miniſter for this time, and this to the ordinary and appointed Miniſter now. Nor will it follow, that the forementioned obliging reference had to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion will bring on us a yoak inſufferable, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. unleſſe wee urged circumciſion it ſelfe, in the very ſymbole and manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring of it, in ſuch ſort, as urged by thoſe legaliſts, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, and as a worke by which perſons are to expect to bee juſtified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3, 4. which none will challenge us for: nay even circumciſion it ſelfe was not that yoake, as Gods inſtituted ſeale of his covenant; even diſſenting brethren ſome of them (for ſuch I ſhould call ſome of them) acknowledge as much in effect, but to urge it on the Gentiles or on their children, as ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. and adding therewith a neceſſitie to keepe the whole law, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. 24. this was that yoake <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. without which both the choyce Jews of old, &amp; thoſe at that time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently others of the Gentiles might bee ſaved, as <hi>Peter</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. As much may bee ſaid to the objections made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this way of arguing from circumciſion, as if there may as well follow other analogies of Prieſts and their garments, &amp;c. It followeth not unleſſe wee make analogy every way parallel, which we decry. So when it is urged that circumciſion don away in Chriſt is an handwriting, is enmity againſt us, is an unprofitable rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a partition wall, proper to the Jewes, overthroweth Chriſtian libertie, is that without which wee are in Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, &amp;c. and therefore not binding; it is true of circumciſion as urged in a legall way, hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. and in reſpect of it ceremoniouſly conſidered in the proper way of adminiſtring it, but if conſidered in the generall nature of it as an initiatory ſeale of the covenant of grace, ſo it was not againſt them, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, &amp;c. and wee Gentiles that are compleat without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the ſymboll and circumſtantials, yet are not ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſubſtantials of it in baptiſme, which is of like nature and uſe ſo farre forth as before was proved.

As firſt, that the command of God was the onely ground of circumciſion, confeſſed to bee the ſeale of the covenant; yea but the Jewes had Church fellowſhip in their circumciſion, all will yeeld as being a Church ordinance, and then the command of God gave them not alone a being in that fellowſhip ſince, <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> the covenant of grace which was ever the forme of the Church, &amp;c. it's ſaid it gave them ſuch a being. Secondly, that the covenant wherein the Jew Church was intereſted, was not a covenant of grace, yet this author produceth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 12, 13. to prove that this covenant of grace was the forme of the Church, and that by this argument amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe it was ever ſo. Surely this Church of old was a true viſible Church, to which theſe places have reference, and yet the whole body of the people are ſpoken of, as the places declare:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41963:110"/> So then the covenant made with them, by this authors grounds was the covenant of grace. Thirdly, that the little ones of the Jewes were not in the covenant of grace; yea but whence then had they that Church being and right to that Church fellowſhip in the ſeale of circumciſion? whence called that covenant Churches children? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. 20, 21. 23. whence elſe are they of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which were to enter into that covenant? <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 11, 12. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the author politiquely leaveth out that <hi>v.</hi> 11. in citing the place, which is here produced to prove the covenant of grace to bee the forme of the Church, and that which giveth one a Church being, and as hee argueth that to be the forme of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was of old ſo: ſo ſay I of the covenant of grace as inveſted with Church covenant: that which was of old the forme of the Church, giving being to Church memberſhip and fellowſhip in Church ordinances, the ſame is now ſuch; but the covenant as made with reſpect to parents and children was of old the forme of the Church giving being to ſuch, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in circumciſion, as of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſo of children, therefore the ſame is now in ſuch ſort the forme of the Church to give a Church being to parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in reſpect of Church fellowſhip in baptiſme, and ſo I conclude againſt that. Fourthly, that children of perſons viſibly in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God and his Church have no right to baptiſme; when yet as hath been proved they have intereſt in the ſame covenant, and ſo conſequently by this very principle laid downe unto this Church initiatory ſeale of baptiſme.

And becauſe they might glory in thoſe peculiar Church ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſeales, which yet they were ſo apt to abuſe, hee ſingles out parallels to them, and therein doth not take inſtance from the ordinary Sacraments of the Jewes, but from two extraordinary ones: wherein, if in any thing, they might ſeeme to bee priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged above others.

                        <hi>That Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles and ſervants of the holy Ghoſt firſt of all to preach the Goſpel and make Diſciples, and afterwards to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41963:115"/> baptize thoſe that were inſtructed in the faith, in calling upon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the name of God.</hi> His proofs out of Scripture are, Matth. 28. 19. Mark 16. 15, 16. Luke 24. 45. John 4. 1, 2. Acts 22. 16.</p>
                     <p>This propoſition might paſſe for the moſt part as current, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a latitude in the word Diſciples: and underſtanding it of ſuch as were baptized meerely in their owne right, and taking that phraſe, calling upon the name of God, as not alwayes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent act of the perſons baptized at the inſtant of their baptiſme, but rather of the Miniſter baptizing; nor doth the inſtance of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 22. 16. prove this latter. It being abſurd even in adult perſons to ſuppoſe it thus in that example of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman that they ſhould in the open face of the Congregation when they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized make their perſonall and particular prayers, Acts 8. 12. or that every one of thoſe 3000. baptized that day, Acts 2. 41. made their ſeverall prayers; for if it wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> eſſentiall to the Ordinance to make ſuch perſonall prayers; ſince there is no ſtint how long, or how much they ſhould utter in calling upon Gods name, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had need to have ſpoken ſeverally to them, that you muſt not bee long, the time is ſhort, and if they had taken that paines, yet many dayes would have beene needfull to ſuch a worke: It was not poſſible to bee diſpatched that very day. As for the other Scriptures they have been elſe-where conſidered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond Propoſition that the Apoſtles and ſervants of the Holy Ghoſt have according to the Commandement of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, firſt of all taught, and then afterwards thoſe that were inſtructed in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdome of God were baptized upon the confeſſion of their faith.</hi> Proofes out of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. How this is a Proof I ſee not, for if hee alwayes preached before hee baptized, it might eaſily have been replyed, Yes <hi>Paul</hi> if God ſent you to baptize any he ſent you alſo to preach, for you are to preach alwayes to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that you baptize, before you doe baptize them: why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe you ſay you were not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel, ſince with the one you do the other? The other proofs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. and 4. 15. are ſomewhat farre fetched and ſtrained, but I will not ſtick there. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. is as well applyed by Authors, <hi>Calvin, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> as grounds of Paedobaptiſme, thoſe being the heads of Catechiſing, containing the ſumme of Chriſtian Doctrin, <hi>ſcil.</hi> profeſſion of faith and repentance, of the articles of which Doctrine an account was demanded of adult Pagans and Jewes at the time of their baptiſme, and therefore called the Doctrine of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41963:115"/> Baptiſmes (alluding in the plurall word to the many typicall waſhings in uſe of old among the Hebrewes or Jewes) but from baptized Infants the ſame was called, for when they were ſolemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted to full Church Communion and declared ſo to bee by the Elders, commending them therein to God by prayer. And hence the ſame Doctrine is called alſo by the name of the Doctrine of Impoſition of hands. Amongſt which articles of that Doctrin two are ſingled out as containing the reſt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the reſurrection of the fleſh and eternall judgement; See <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza, in Locum.</hi> His next proofe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. I let paſſe. In the next proofe <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36, 38. 41. I obſerve how craftily the 39th. Verſ. is left out unmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, wherein the ſtrength of argument on our part doth conſiſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36, 37, 38. and 10. 47, 48. and 16. 31. to 34. But why is that example of <hi>Lydia</hi> here left out, and her houſhold, but that it ſpeakes too broadly, that albeit the Apoſtles ſometimes required confeſſion of ſome perſons which they baptized, yet not alwayes of all ſorts of perſons, as that one example witneſſeth? His other Scripture is that Acts 18. 8. but of all theſe conſideration is elſewhere had. This Propoſition with the limitations former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned may paſſe, ſuppoſing it not underſtood excluſively, that ſuch as they baptized were ſuch, therefore they baptized none other but ſuch, which is a <hi>non ſequitur.</hi>

                        <hi>That after the Apoſtles time by the ancient fathers in the primitive Church, who obſerved and followed the Ordinance of Chriſt, and the example of the Apoſtle, the people were commonly firſt inſtructed in the myſteries of faith, and after that they were taught they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon confeſſion of the ſame.</hi>

                     <p>This Propoſition, <hi>ſano ſenſu,</hi> might paſſe alſo, underſtanding that that was the Ordinance of Chriſt, and practiſe of the Apoſtles ſo farre as concernes growne perſons baptiſme: but yet that was not all intended in the one, nor practiſed by the other. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it ſelfe implyeth as much, ſaying commonly it was ſo, the people being not as now many are, in a manner wholly profeſſing Chriſt, but rather wholly Pagan and Prophane and Idolatrous; but alwayes it was not ſo even then; for their little ones which were not brought to the faith were alſo baptized.</p>

                        <hi>That by the ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church, the children both of the faithfull and others, were commonly firſt inſtituted in the faith, and afterwards upon acknowledging and confeſſing of the ſame they were baptized.</hi>

                     <p>This Propoſition is full of equivocall termes, it may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſe without ſome Animadverſions: for it may ſo be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to ſtand with truth, yet ſo alſo as to bee utterly falſe. [Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church] may bee underſtood of the Church in the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly following the Apoſtles time, or as in ſome of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, for the Church that ſucceeded more then an 100. yeares, yea poſſibly 200. or 300. afterwards. <hi>Rupertus Tiulienſis</hi> ſaith it was the cuſtome of the Church of old that they adminiſtred the Sacrament of regeneration onely at Eaſter and Pentecoſt, &amp;c. which if it begun in <hi>Victors</hi> time, to whom that reſtraint of the time of baptiſme, unleſſe in caſe of neceſſitie, is attributed as the Author of it about the yeere 290. Albeit <hi>Rivet</hi> in his firſt Book <hi>Critici Sacri, cap.</hi> 8. citeth the <hi>Magdeburge</hi> hiſtorians <hi>centur.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. as proving the Decretalls aſcribed to <hi>Victor</hi> to be ſpurious; or if not then, but ſome time in the third Centurie, yet it ſufficeth to ſhew in what Latitude of time <hi>Rupertus</hi> his expreſſions runne when hee ſpeaketh of what was the uſe in the Church of old. And in the primitive Church, in this Latitude, it's probable there might bee ſundry which upon corrupt grounds might deferre both their own and their childrens baptiſme too, as appeares by the Orations of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſtirring up as to come more ſpeedily themſelves to bee baptized, ſo to offer their little ones at the moſt, if no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bee towards, (in which caſe hee adviſeth the ſame ſooner) when three yeeres old, if ſo long deferred, yet then to offer them to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which was before they could bee able to make ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the faith, or confeſſion of their ſinnes. But more of him afterwards. [Children of the faithfull] if hee intend ſuch children as were knowing and able to underſtand truth taught them, ſo as to bee apprehenſive of their ſinnes, &amp;c. It's true, they uſed when any were received into Church fellowſhip, which had ſuch adult children at that time, thoſe to inſtruct in that way before thoſe children were baptized. But if underſtood of little ones not capable of ſuch an iſſue and effect of ſuch inſtruction, thoſe they uſed alſo then to baptize before ſuch inſtructions. And for this let the Authors owne teſtimonies which hee quoteth, Propoſition 7. of <hi>Origen, Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourth witneſſe. For wee now ſpeake not to that, whether it were onely a Church cuſtome and tradition, &amp;c. wee ſhall ſpeake to that afterwards. But ſuppoſe it were onely a Church cuſtome and tradition, yet its proofe ſufficient that it was ſo anciently in uſe as there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41963:116"/> that even children were baptized before they were thus inſtructed, as the cited places declare, of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                        <hi>Hierom</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. is quoted Propoſition 1. and 8. <q rend="inline">The Lord, ſaith he, commanded his Apoſtles, that they ſhould firſt inſtruct and teach all nations, and afterward ſhould baptize thoſe that were inſtructed in the myſteries of faith; for it cannot bee that the body ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament of baptiſme, unleſſe the ſoule have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before the true faith.</q> This whole teſtimony is intended by the Author of growne ones, in what way adult Pagans are to bee baptized, and of their receiving of baptiſme, ſo as to have the ſaving benefit of it. But to make it his mind to intend excluſion of Babes is to make him worke and practiſe things againſt the light of his owne judgement and conſcience. The Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing in the eight propoſition, that his proofes are out of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient &amp; later teachers, who have and do maintaine the uſe of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing children, and <hi>Hierom</hi> is one hee quoteth. As for <hi>Hieroms</hi> judgement this way, ſee his firſt Tome, his 7th. Epiſtle, <hi>ſcil. ad Laetam,</hi> where having ſaid before that the good and evill of little children is aſcribed to the parents, hee addeth, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>niſi forte exiſtimes Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anorum filios, &amp;c.</hi> unleſſe thou thinke that if the children of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians receive not baptiſme, the children onely are guilty of the ſinne, and that the wickedneſſe is not alſo imputed to thoſe that would not give the ſame to them; eſpecially at that time when the children which were to receive baptiſme, could not contradict the ſame; as on the other hand the ſalvation of the Infants is the Anceſtors gaine.</q> Hee reckons that there is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe in it careleſly to neglect ſuch an ordinance, that tendeth to their ſpirituall gaine in their childrens good thereby furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Now if <hi>Hierom</hi> thought there were no Law for childrens bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, why is there any tranſgreſſion, yea ſo deepe charged upon the neglectors of it, that it is <hi>ſcelus</hi> in his account? So in his ſecond <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Dialogorum adverſus Pelagianos ad finem;</hi> hee proveth infants baptiſme to bee for remiſſion of ſinnes, as well as for entrance into Gods kingdome; ſo that this Authors words are wreſted againſt his owne intention.</p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:41963:117"/>
                     <p>Let us ſee whether the next be better dealt withall, <hi>ſcil. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> in his third Sermon <hi>contra Arrianos:</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">Our Saviour did not ſlightly command to baptize, but firſt of all hee ſaid, Teach, and then baptize, that true faith might come by teaching, and baptiſme bee perfected by Faith.</q> If <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had ſaid thus in the Authors ſenſe, yet the fallacy had ſtill beene the ſame to conclude <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> But let us look upon that place and weigh the words of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> there ſpeaking of the unprofitableneſſe and vanitie of Baptiſme by Arrians; hee proceedeth thus. <q rend="inline">For (ſaith hee) the Arrians doe not give Baptiſme in the Father and Sonne, but in the Creator and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the maker and workmanſhip: As therefore a creature is a diverſe thing from the Sonne, ſo is the Baptiſme ſuppoſed to bee given by them diverſe from true Baptiſme. Albeit becauſe they ſee the names of Father and Sonne in Scriptures, they doe faine to name them, for it is not hee that barely nameth the Lord which giveth lawfull Baptiſme, but hee that expoundeth that name and holdeth the right faith. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth not command to baptize after any faſhion</q> (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors render the word <hi>quovis modo</hi> by <hi>ſlightly</hi>) <q rend="inline">but firſt hee ſaid Teach and then baptize (in the name of the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt)</q> (this clauſe the treatiſe leaveth out) that by teaching a right faith might ariſe (the treatiſe ſaith true faith might come) <q rend="inline">and with the faith of Baptiſme the intire initiation might bee perfected;</q> by initiation hee meanes baptiſme as the words before theſe ſhew. In theſe words. <q rend="inline">The Arrians hazzard the loſſe of the integrity of that myſtery. But I ſpeake of Baptiſme. For if perfect and full initiation bee given in the name of the Father and Sonne, and they hold not forth the true Father, &amp;c. how ſhould the Baptiſme which they give bee true, &amp;c.</q> So that that ſpeech, with the faith of Baptiſme the intire initiation might bee perfected, is that with the faith or doctrine of faith rightly held out, the Ordinance of Baptiſme might bee perfect or valid, which hee calleth the right faith, as the words before mentioned ſhew: So that hee doth not here intend <hi>fidem quâ credit aliquis, ſed fidem quam credit,</hi> hee meaneth it of the object, not the habit of faith; and of the qualifications of the perſons baptizing, to make their act valid, not of the parties baptized. For none will ſay that an hypocrites Baptiſme, becauſe hee hath not true faith, is not true Baptiſme: The eſſence of the Ordinance not depending
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41963:118"/> upon mans faith but Gods word. And that hee intends no other thing as it appeares by the premiſes, for if you take his next words following the ſame, it will bee evident. Truely, ſaith he, even other hereſies, and thoſe not a few, doe in ſeeming words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that rite of baptizing, but being not right in judgement, nor retaining the ſound faith, they poſſeſſe and beſtow an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable water, as deſtitute of the Deity of Religion, ſo that they which are ſprinkled by them, are rather polluted through corrupt Religion, then redeemed. Here therefore is an ancient Authors words wreſted to another ſenſe then the ſcope of his diſcourſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſome words left out which ſerved to declare his meaning, and other words ſo palpably miſtranſlated that the Reader is groſſely abuſed thereby as well as the Author.</p>

                        </q> This later one would thinke might have expounded the former, that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it of adult Pagans, and not of others in Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſuch as ours are whoſe foundations are already laid and eſtabliſhed. And Propoſition 6. <q rend="inline">It's no where expreſſed in the Apoſtolicall writings that they baptized children.</q> Hee doth not ſay, it's not ſo much as probable nor is it to bee gathered by conſequence that they did ſo: wherefore his teſtimony is no proofe that the Apoſtles never did baptize Infants, becauſe it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mentioned expreſly. It's never expreſly ſaid, that I remember, that the Apoſtles or Evangeliſts when they Baptized thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and 8. and 16. 18. that they called upon God for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the Ordinance, but will it follow that they did not ſanctifie the Ordinance by Prayer? Propoſition 7. hee is quoted as a proofe of that Propoſition, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de ratione concion.</hi> ſaying <q rend="inline">that they are not to bee condemned that doubt whether chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens baptiſme was ordained by the Apoſtles, and thinke that the ſame is to be received as the <hi>placita Scholaſticorum Theologorum,</hi> which cannot bee proved by Scripture.</q> Here the Authors uſe their old art of ſubſtraction and addition. His words are thus. <q rend="inline">It is probable that to baptize Infants was inſtituted by the Apoſtles, and yet they are not to bee condemned which doubt thereof; With the ſame moderation many tenents of Schoole Divines are to bee received, which cannot (evidently) be proved from the Scriptures.</q> The firſt ſpeech of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> is wholly left out, which is croſſe both to that peremptory if not impudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion expreſſed in the 6th. Propoſition, and this ſet downe in the 7th. if even <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his judgement bee adhered to, for if it bee probable that Paedobaptiſme was of Apoſtolicall inſtitution, then it is not ſo peremptorily and with ſuch plerophory to bee aſſerted that it was never ordained of Chriſt, or practiſed by the Apoſtles,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41963:119"/> but is an ordinance of man. And whereas it is rendred, and think that the ſame is to bee received <hi>inter placita Scholaſticorum, &amp;c.</hi> there is no ſuch connexion or expreſſion. But it is a diſtinct ſentence. With the ſame moderation, &amp;c. many Schoole tenents are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, &amp;c. <hi>ſcil.</hi> they are alſo not to bee condemned which doubt of ſome Schoole tenents which are not ſo expreſſe and cleare from Scripture. Hee doth not ſay that Baptiſme of of Infants is to bee thought <hi>placitum Scholaſticorum,</hi> but ſpeakes of other inſtances of things probable. Nor doth hee ſpeake of bare Schoole Notions which have no bottome at all in Scripture, and which cannot at all bee proved from the Scripture as the Treatiſe ſaith; which cannot bee proved, but which cannot <hi>evidenter probari per Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</hi> True it is, <hi>Henry Denne</hi> hee ſaith that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taxeth <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> with that opinion of denying childrens Baptiſme; but in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his preface to his Paraphraſe on <hi>Matthew,</hi> hee rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the careleſneſſe of Prieſts, in ſo much that many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are in reſpect of knowledge rather as Pagans; and at beſt are rather in titles, cuſtomes, and ceremonies Chriſtians then indeed: And adviſeth that children after they have been baptized, and come to riper yeeres, that they bee well inſtructed in what their ſureties have promiſed for them, and called to account how they profit thereby, and whether they doe avouch and owne the promiſe made by their ſureties, and if ſo, then at ſome time or other that they in the open Congregation expreſſing it, bee then with ſome ſolemnitie approved. And if they reject this motion, then to be debarred the Euchariſt, untill they change their mind: So that hee ſeemeth not to diſallow Paedobaptiſme, but careleſneſſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. This I ſpeake that none may bee rendred worſe then they are, bee they Papiſts or others.

And no more doth he intend excluſion of Infants from Baptiſme, by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the neceſſitie of confeſſion in <hi>Johns</hi> hearers unto Baptiſme, then by affirming that the ſame was required of thoſe <hi>Catechumens</hi> mentioned. Let us then ſee <hi>Beza</hi>'s mind further therein, which wee may readily doe in the third place of <hi>Beza</hi> quoted in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe Propoſition 4. where <hi>Beza</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. But now your children are holy, he is thus cited as ſaying: <q rend="inline">Out of this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors of the truth are revealed. As firſt, all thoſe that make Baptiſme to be the firſt entrance to ſalvation: and ſecondly, thoſe that permit all children to bee baptized, which was unheard of in the primitive times, whereas [every one] ought to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d in the faith before hee were admitted to baptiſme.</q> And this teſtimony is brought to prove the Propoſition that in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church the children both of the faithfull and elſe (<hi>ſcil.</hi> and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41963:121"/> of Pagans or Jewes) were commonly firſt inſtructed, &amp;c. and then baptized; ſo that <hi>Beza</hi>'s mind in that clauſe, whereas every one ought to bee inſtructed, &amp;c. is made, and every child whether of the faithfull or Infidell ſhould bee firſt inſtructed before hee be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and in that ſenſe, his ſecond errour he blames of ſuch which permit all children to bee baptized, is as much as if hee ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it as an errour to permit any children at all whether of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or infidell perſons to bee baptized before inſtructed: So that <hi>Beza</hi> is by this made a direct Andipedobaptiſt, as they terme it now for modeſty ſake. But you ſhall not have <hi>Beza</hi> thus on your ſide before wee heare him in his owne words, who having before ſpoken touching the cauſe, why wee admit the Saints children to baptiſme, <hi>ſcil.</hi> becauſe they are comprehended in the Covenant, &amp;c. he addeth, <q rend="inline">Now from hence are confuted not onely <hi>Catabaptiſts</hi> which doe reject Infants from baptiſme as uncleane, but <hi>thoſe</hi> which make baptiſme the firſt entrance to ſalvation, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all from ſalvation which are unbaptized, and alſo <hi>thoſe</hi> which admit all Infants whatſoever to baptiſme,</q> (<hi>ſcil.</hi> whether of viſible Saints or Infidels as appeares by what hee ſaid before, and by what followeth, which thing (<hi>ſcil.</hi> ſuch promiſcuous baptizing of all ſorts hand over head) <q rend="inline">was not heard of in the ancient Church. As this at leaſt doth declare, in that all adult Infidells were firſt to bee <hi>Catechumens</hi> before they were baptized.</q> 
                        <hi>Beza</hi> refuteth three things from that clauſe mentioned and explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned — now your children are holy, and one of them is this fourth Propoſition of the Authors, and yet by the Authors he is brought to refute onely two things. Firſt, hee refuteth <hi>Catabaptiſts</hi> denying baptiſme to beleevers children. Secondly, he from the ſame ground refuteth them which maintaine the baptiſme of all children what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that are not children of viſible Saints, for if they bee ſuch children hee counteth it rather an errour to deny their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Againe in citing the laſt part of <hi>Beza</hi>'s words, the Authors craftily make it as an oppoſite ſentence to that before. Thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thoſe that permit all children to bee baptized, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every one, &amp;c. as if it were a contrary ſpeech to the former, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting (all) children, &amp;c. whereas none (at all) were to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of old, but ſuch as were <hi>Catechumens:</hi> when <hi>Beza</hi> maketh this later a reaſon of the former, as before wee ſhewed. Beſides the Authors ſhamefully change and mutilate the laſt words: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every one ought, &amp;c. intending every particular perſon, Infant or
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41963:121"/> Aged, when <hi>Beza</hi>'s words are expreſly — in that all adult Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells ought firſt to bee <hi>Catachumens</hi> before they were to bee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Now who is there which doth not even feele this palpable guile and falſeſhood in the ſetters forth of this Treatiſe in this particular? But not to forget what wee noted touching <hi>Beza</hi>'s other teſtimony on <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. this place cleareth <hi>Beza</hi>'s intent. There ſpeaking of adult perſons it may bee affirmed ſuch muſt bee as the <hi>Catechumens</hi> of old in point of confeſſion before baptiſme, and yet the ſame Author never intend by that aſſertion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude children of ſuch as doe make ſuch confeſſion of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from baptiſme. <hi>Beza</hi> which holdeth this forth here, yet here alſo refuteth that as errour in Catabaptiſts to deny Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: So that ſtill here is the old fallacie, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid ad ſimpliciter dictum.</hi>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41963:122"/> of Infants will bee oppoſed, which receive the promiſe and yet cannot have the faith of baptiſme, and therefore either faith is not required, or Infants baptiſme is null. Here (ſaith hee) I ſay that which all ſay, that Infants are helped by the faith of others, even of them which offer them. For as the Word of God is forcible whilſt uttered to change the heart of a wicked man, which is not leſſe deafe and uncapable then any little one; ſo by the Prayer of the Church offering and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, even a little one having faith infuſed is changed, cleanſed, and renewed by him to whom all things are poſſible.</q> For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation whereof hee brings that example, <hi>Marke</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. And in his 7th.

And ſo they onely that truely beleeve are truely baptized, and others baptized which doe not beleeve, they are againe to bee baptized when they doe beleeve,</q> (<hi>ſcil.</hi> albeit growne ones, when baptized if then hypocrites.) As for <hi>Luthers</hi> other two ſpeeches mentioned Propoſition 7. and 8. I ſomewhat wonder if hee ſhould utter them as here expreſſed, that in that booke ſtiled <hi>Lutheri Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutherana opera fratris Joan.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41963:123"/> Supper: the next Article to bee ſo compoſed and explained to all their content was that about baptiſme. The Article was this: <q rend="inline">touching baptiſme of Infants, all without any doubting agree, that it's neceſſary that Infants ſhould bee baptized, for ſince the promiſe of ſalvation doth alſo belong to Infants, and it pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to thoſe which are without the Church, it is therefore neceſſary that it ſhould bee applied by the Miniſtery, and to conjoyne them to the members of the Church.</q> The explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Article annexed. <q rend="inline">This is to bee underſtood of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie in reſpect of Miniſtery and by command of God, and not of neceſſitie in reſpect of ſalvation, &amp;c.</q> unto which as to the reſt ſubſcribed <hi>Martinus Lutherus, Doctor Witebergenſis, Johannes Bugenhagius Pomeranus, Doctor Philippus Melancton, Juſtus Menius Iſenacenſis, &amp;c.</hi> And on the other ſide <hi>M. Martinus Bucerus Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Eccleſiae Argentinenſis, Wolſangus Muſculus eccleſiae Auguſtanae Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in verbo,</hi> and divers others. I have ſet downe this ſtory the fuller as it's mentioned amongſt <hi>Bucers</hi> workes in that I ſhall have frequent occaſion to referre to it.<note place="margin">

                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to returne to <hi>Luther,</hi> hee is one that holdeth baptiſme not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation, as that without which one cannot bee ſaved, (as is further expreſſed in the explication of that Article) but as neceſſary unto Infants by vertue of divine precept. Surely if hee had no ſcruple in this point, as it's ſaid all agreed herein without doubting, &amp;c. he never imagined that which the Authors of this Treatiſe would make him to affirme, that baptiſme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants came in foure or five hundred yeers after Chriſts time as an inſtitution of Popes or councells.</p>
                     <p>I might have mentioned that paſſage of <hi>Luthers</hi> (to the former two teſtimonies touching faith required to baptiſme) which hee hath in his Preface to his Commentary upon the <hi>Galatians.</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts (ſaith hee) teach that baptiſme is nothing except the perſons beleeve, out of which principle it will follow that all the workes of God are nothing, if the man bee nothing, for baptiſme is the worke of God, &amp;c.</q> But this is certaine that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> taking the Doctrine of baptiſme of Infants as unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rather argueth thence to prove that Infants have faith (which was a tenet of his owne) then that faith is required in them to their baptiſme. Thus Infants unleſſe that they have faith it will bee ſaid they are not to bee baptized, but all grant that Infants are to bee baptized, therefore Infants have faith.</p>

                        <hi>Auſtin</hi> is againe quoted for proofe of the 7th.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41963:125"/> 
                        <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the next Chapter within five or ſix lines of that in the 23. Chapter mentioned, giveth his arguments to prove that it could not bee delivered to the Church, but by Apoſtolicall authoritie; firſt, in that it was never inſtituted by any councells; ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ever held by the Churches, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſince there was any Church planted by the Apoſtles: and I thinke his arguments are weightie, other things which were of ſuch note (as this of Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme was if innovations) either they may bee proved that they came in by ſuch or ſuch councells or authors, or it may be proved, that there was never any ſuch thing in uſe before ſuch or ſuch a time, which in this caſe will be hard for any to undertake to make the ſame good by convincing teſtimonies or arguments.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to our Authors, they bring in this teſtimony to prove that baptiſme of Infants was inſtituted by councells, <note n="*" place="margin">The firſt witneſſe ſaith flatly it was not inſtituted by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</note> what forgery is this? they make him their witneſſe to prove it to bee an ordinance of man, the witneſſe proveth that it's of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: What notable jugling is this? Will they never leave this trade? Let us examine the other place where <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith that it is a Church cuſtome, if our Authors ſpeake truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth of the place quoted, the words there are as followeth, <q rend="inline">the cuſtome of our mother the Church in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants is not to bee deſpiſed, nor by any meanes is the ſame to be thought ſuperfluous.</q> Yery good then will they ſay, this place is full for us. Nay ſtay Sirs, be not too haſty to interrupt the witneſſe, whilſt hee is ſpeaking; let him ſpeake all hee hath here to ſay, <hi>ſcil.</hi> nor were it at all to bee beleeved, unleſſe it were an Apoſtolicall tradition, &amp;c. <q rend="inline">So you heare Sirs, hee tells you; it's ſuch a Church cuſtome, as withall, it is an Apoſtolicall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</q> and that in the other place quoted, is of Divine authority hee makes account, which is delivered to the Church by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. As indeed it is, unleſſe that any thinke that the Apoſtles in their Apoſtolicall miniſtry erred, and delivered that to the Church, as the mind, meaning and intent of Chriſt, which hee never meant. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath the very ſame words, as here in his third Epiſtle <hi>ad Yoluſiam:</hi> Nay leſt there ſhould bee any ſtick in the words, <hi>traditum ab Apoſtolis,</hi> and Apoſtolicall tradition, hee peremptorily affirmeth, (ſpeaking of the Churches authority in this caſe of Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſme) <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de peccat. merit. &amp; remiſſ. cap.</hi> 16 — <q rend="inline">

                     <p>But our Authors here will not leave <hi>Auſtin</hi> thus, but they will make him ſpeake for them ere they have done, therefore hee is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe in the 28th.

Nay pag. 32. our Authors are ſilent, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quote the place, not the words, and leave us to finde the ſenſe out, as <hi>Nebuchanezzar</hi> did his dreame and them to interpret it. But let mee aſſure them <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth rather confirme the contrary, in that Epiſtle, then otherwiſe; clearing both the ſpirituall ends of Chriſtian parents, in haſtning with their children to Baptiſme: and ratifying <hi>Cyprians</hi> judgement touching the caſe of Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that hee therein did not frame ſome new decree, but held the moſt firme beleefe of the Church that way. And poſſibly the Authors by adding this teſtimony of <hi>Auſtin</hi> to that of <hi>Cyprians</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, and on this ſay, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ordeined children ſhould bee baptized, they bring this to confirme it, which doth indeed confirme it, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> held this, and ratified this — but not as the firſt Author of it, (which perhaps the Treatiſe would make the world beleeve) but rather as that which the Chriſtian Church had ever firmely beleeved. According as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 10th.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41963:126"/> yet that hinders not, but the bottome and foundation of that Ordinance was good and ſure; you will not ſay becauſe Papiſts hold baptiſme to bee of neceſſitie to ſalvation, that therefore bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of growne perſons is no Ordinance. That other ſpeech of <hi>Auſtins</hi> — that as thoſe were circumciſed which were borne of circumciſed parents, even ſo ſhould they bee baptized which are borne of parents that are baptized, is ſound and good, and no proofe of that 7th.

And ſo when hee there ſaith: <q rend="inline">But wee have learned that immortalitie (<hi>ſcil.</hi> of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe) is onely theirs who live honeſtly and holily before God;</q> therefore they had learned, that the kingdome of glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to no Infants: For they could not live ſo: here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not thinke that excluſive particle [onely] concluding againſt babes, to whom hee holdeth the kingdome of glory doth belong, and why then is a particle farre leſſe excluſive, ſo concluſive againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? When <hi>Juſtin</hi> in that Apology commeth to ſpeake of the other Sacrament of the Lords Supper — hee ſaith, <q rend="inline">unto which none is admitted, but hee that doth beleeve our Doctrine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been waſhed in the Laver of regeneration unto the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, &amp;c.</q> but hee ſaith not ſo in the other — none but ſuch as beleeve what wee teach to bee true, &amp;c. are waſhed or bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, &amp;c.

So they endeavour to make us daily infamous by objecting impious crimes againſt us — and — heinous things are divulged of us through the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tales of putting out light, and then lying promiſcuouſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; of devouring mans fleſh, &amp;c. and that at our ſacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries we promiſcuouſly commit filthineſſe, &amp;c.</q> So that it were impertinent to mention their religious way of devoting and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up their children to God, they were not accuſed, no apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is needed for them; but it's meet to apologize onely for the perſons accuſed, and declare what manner of perſons they are, and how they devote themſelves to higher and holier uſes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Let the reaſons bee weighed which <hi>Juſtin</hi> here urged, why they baptized perſons adult, and with him that urgeth thoſe for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it enforceth more then probable grounds to convince, that Baptiſme of their Infants was in uſe. For having ſpoken of that their being new borne, as they were, (that is Baptized) hee gives theſe two things as reaſons: <hi>Dixit enim Chriſtus, Niſi renati fueritis, non intrabitis in regnum caelorum;</hi> &amp; addes — <hi>rationem ejus rei hanc accepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ab Apoſtolis, quoniam prima nativitas, nec ſcientibus, nec volentibus nobis ex complexu parentum, humoreque, genitali, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, the neceſſitie of regeneration in and by Baptiſme (as the ordinary way.) [For ſo hee underſtands <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. whether rightly or no, I diſpute not, but to him it was ſo and that ſufficeth.] Secondly, the native pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and originall ſinne (for that hee intends by nativitie] re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their parents; which are reaſons valid as well for baptiſme of Infants as growne ones too, and with any, to whom they are reaſons for Baptiſme, and are the very reaſons uſed by <hi>Origen, Cyprian, Ierom, Ambroſe, Auſtin,</hi> and others, whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was for baptiſme of Infants, as well as adult perſons.</p>
                     <p>Yea but there is no mention made here of Infants baptiſme, no nor was it ſuitable to the occaſion of the Apology, as wee ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and yet it followeth not, that it was not practiſed then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not expreſſed. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, hee ſets downe here the practiſe of the Church, both for word, prayer and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and that <hi>ex profeſſo.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may perceive that there is no mention of any doctrinall inſtructions held out at the baptizing of perſons, or at the adminiſtration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41963:128"/> occaſioned by the joyning of new members to them at other times. Afterwards indeed when hee commeth to ſpeake of the manner of their carrying it on the Lords day, hee mentioneth ſomething that way, but nothing in ſpeaking of occaſionall meetings for ſolemn cloſing with baptized perſons at other times. Yet I thinke Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would bee loth to conclude the word was not taught, when the Sacraments were adminiſtred to any. If he omit a thing which is <hi>profeſſo,</hi> hee was to mention, what wonder if he paſſe over in ſilence a matter of which hee had not then occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpeake? <hi>Tertullian de corona militis</hi> ſaith almoſt as much in ſubſtance as <hi>Iuſtin,</hi> and it is as well urged againſt Paedobaptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſaith, when wee come together to the water, wee doe promiſe there to renounce the Devill, &amp;c. Yet it is evident Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants was in uſe in his time; why elſe doth hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it, and would not have their Suſceptors runne hazzards by becomming ſureties for them?

                        <hi>BAſil</hi> is the next Author brought in, <hi>Contra Eunomium l.</hi> 3. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q rend="inline">muſt the faithfull bee ſealed with Baptiſme?</q> Faith muſt praecede and goe before. Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> inlargeth the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in words to like purpoſe. <q rend="inline">For Baptiſme is the ſeale of faith, faith the confeſſion of the Deity: For firſt hee, (<hi>ſcil.</hi> that is made godly by grace of whom hee before ſpake) muſt firſt beleeve and after bee ſealed with baptiſme — and — baptiſme is the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the debt of priſoners, the death of ſinne, the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule, — How can this, ſaith Mr. <hi>Backwood,</hi> bee affirmed of Infants? And againe — I will roule in mire — walke deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly — ſweare and lie, and then when I am full with evills, I will ceaſe and receive baptiſme</q> — which ſhewes ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> at what time perſons were wont to bee baptized, not in their Infancy, but when they were men, if the faithfull — if one that is made godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by grace bee to bee baptized — hee muſt firſt profeſſe his faith: <hi>ergo,</hi> none other is to bee baptized, if brought to baptiſme in any other way — <hi>non ſequitur;</hi> yea but that doth plainly reſiſt the tradition of wholeſome baptiſme — For baptiſme is the ſeale of faith, &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Baſil.</hi> What doth reſiſt the wholeſome tradition of baptiſm? Paedobaptiſme without actuall faith expreſſed? — <hi>Baſil</hi> intended it not, but if one that is made godly by grace (being changeable by nature) ſometimes by negligence fall from grace, &amp;c. and ſo hold forth any other thing then is conſonant to the doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie confeſſed in Baptiſme; This is reſiſting that tradition of Baptiſme, he doth not intend by tradition of Baptiſme a rule that onely actuall confeſſors of the Trinitie muſt bee baptized. Let him expound himſelfe; for in his fifth booke againſt <hi>Eunomius</hi> pag. 119. ſpeaking of that forme of baptizing in the name of the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, hee calleth that the tradition, <hi>ſcil.</hi> touching baptiſme, if by his deſcription hee intend the ſeale of faith, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Covenant and doctrine of faith, it hurts us not, if of faith whereby wee beleeve, it is an imperfect deſcription of baptiſme. Baptiſme, ſaith hee, is the forgiveneſſe of ſinne, &amp;c. if he meane it, that it is ſo really to all that are baptized, then <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> had not periſhed in their ſinnes, if hee ſpeake it, that it is ſo Sacramentally, that may bee affirmed of Infants Baptiſme. As for Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s expoſition that <hi>Baſils</hi> other ſpeech, I will lie and ſweare, and when full of evills &amp;c. then receive Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41963:129"/> ſheweth the time when perſons were wont to bee baptized; I wonder at his collection, doth hee thinke men ſhould ſinne to the full, till they are even weary, and then come to bee baptized? is that a fit time, when they have ſerved the Devill to the utmoſt, and been his old ſworne truſtees, then to liſt themſelves under Chriſts command? Verily if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinke ſo, <hi>Baſil</hi> did not, for hee rather reproveth perſons for deferring their Baptiſme, as if a man might bemire himſelfe in ſinne as much as hee would, and then at laſt one waſhing in baptiſme would make all clean, which hee thus ſarcaſtically derideth.</p>

                        <hi>Aretius</hi> had no ſuch thought of <hi>Baſils</hi> judgement in this caſe, who yet had reaſon to know <hi>Baſils</hi> mind, better then Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or <hi>I.</hi> And hee in his Commentary on <hi>Luke</hi> 18. brings in <hi>Baſil</hi> as uſing this argument amongſt others — <hi>Infantes capaces ſunt <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

It is evident that the baptiſme of ſuch perſons was deferred through corruption in the perſons, whom it concerned.

Whence it is that <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> refuteth that ground of deferring bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.

                        <q rend="inline">that thoſe which would bee for ever great, muſt bee ſuch as they are,</q> and brings that as another argument of it: that God was ſo gratious to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Midwives for ſparing of the Jewes children, ſo that hee ſpeakes not this of all children but of thoſe of the Church, as alſo that which hee ſaith <hi>de anima,</hi> hee ſpeaketh it not of all ſorts, but of the children of the faithfull, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And hence I will make bold after Maſter <hi>Blackwoods</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make ſome obſervations. 1 That <hi>Tertullian</hi> accounted not all children alike in point of birth — cleanneſſe, but ſome cleane, others uncleane. 2 That hee accounted that holineſſe of children mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. to bee no civill holineſſe of legitimacy, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holineſſe of holineſſe to uſe, but a holineſſe of a higher nature: ſuch as implyeth right, at leaſt externall, of entring in Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: making this of being holy to be one with that, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it (<hi>ſcil.</hi> according to men) and to include as much as to bee accounted in Chriſt, <hi>cap.</hi> 22. the beginning. 3 That children, of beleevers come to bee holy in this ſenſe mentioned, not by inſtruction of diſcipline meerely of which they are capable when they come to yeers: but by being borne of either parents ſanctified or the faithfull, or perſons laying hold on Gods covenant, &amp;c. (for hee maketh being borne of either parents ſanctified and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithfull, &amp;c. one) they are holy as well by prerogative of ſeed (ſaith hee of which they are partakers as ſoone as they are borne) as by inſtitution of diſcipline. 4 That he maketh this the force of the Apoſtles argument to perſwade to retaine marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in queſtion in regard of ſuch pledges of hope, children thus holy ſpringing from married perſons whereof one at leaſt is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, &amp;c. 5 That therefore <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was not the firſt author as ſome ſay of that interpretation, that by the ſanctifying of either Sex by that other being faithfull, children come to bee holy with holineſſe of priviledge, hence that of being holy by prerogative of ſeed, <hi>ſcil. quat.</hi> covenant ſeed. And from the other place it appeares that <hi>Tertullian</hi> judged the children of the Jewes to bee not in a bare carnall covenant, or beloved with a meere common reſpect of God as others, but in the judgement of his charitie hee accounts them beloved, with a ſpeciall love of God: ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come patternes to ſuch as are alwayes great in Gods favour as well as otherwiſe. Now how theſe things will ſtand with <hi>Tertullians</hi> denying them baptiſme, I leave to all judicious and ſober minds to determine: hee may forſake his owne principles in this as in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41963:134"/> other things, hee did; but if hee hold to the ſame hee muſt bee ours and not yours.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſuppoſe <hi>Tertullians</hi> judgement againſt paedobaptiſme: hee is not the firſt that gave erroneous counſell, and held erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous tenents: though he bee the firſt that ever adviſed (ſo farre as I finde in authors) that infants baptiſme ſhould bee delayed, and his judgement may not carry it, but the grounds of his judgement if they are Scripture proofe; and firſt he acknowledgeth the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taken from <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. Suffer little children to come unto me, to enforce baptiſme of theſe there intended: albeit hee expounds that of their comming to Chriſt by baptiſme to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of their comming, when they are growne up, when they know Chriſt, when they aske it, when they underſtand the right of Baptiſme, and can pray and faſt. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (which cleaveth to <hi>Tertullian</hi>) and others of his minde, denye it to bee any ground of baptizing any. 2 Hee counſelleth (as the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe hath it) that unmarried folke ſhould have their baptiſme alſo deferred, whileſt they yet ſuffer tenttaions; the Treatiſe indeed ſaith, young unmarried virgins: but <hi>Tertullians</hi> word is, <hi>Innupti,</hi> unmarried perſons, of what age ſoever, now how doe Anabaptiſts like <hi>Tertullians</hi> counſell herein? Suppoſe a perſon never marry, what, muſt he never bee baptized as never yet ſuffering this tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? or ſuppoſe young perſons of 20. or 30. yeares old, judged to be beleevers, but yet not married; they belong to Gods kingdom, but have not yet ſuffered ſuch tentation, muſt their baptiſme now be deferred upon this ground of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> becauſe not married, or not yet going through ſuch tentations? I trow not; then <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> counſell about delay of baptiſme is not good it ſeemeth.</p>
                     <p>3 Hee counſels delay of baptiſme of any to Eaſter and Pentecoſt (albeit therein hee ſpeaketh not ſo peremptorily as in the other) Was this good counſell to put baptiſme to ſuch ſet times of the yeare, when yet no time is ſet in the Scriptures, both <hi>John</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples, and the Apoſtles baptized at any time of the year. I ſuppoſe this counſell will not downe with them.</p>
                     <p>4 Hee counſels delay of Infants baptiſme (for it was but his counſell at the moſt as it was in the other) anſwering therein that argument, which even in his time was uſed for paedobaptiſme (not firſt by <hi>Zuinglius</hi>) <hi>ſcil. Suffer little Children to come unto mee, and forbid them not, &amp;c.</hi> Yea (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) let them come indeed, but <hi>dum Adoleſcant, &amp;c.</hi> when they are growne up, &amp;c. hee yeeldeth it to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41963:134"/> bee a ground of their comming to Chriſt, and that by baptiſme as one way of their comming to him; but not of their comming ſo ſoone, but rather when they themſelves could aske it, &amp;c. this is his gloſſe upon the place: but how abſurd is this gloſſe, as if Chriſts intent in rebuking the Diſciples for hindring thoſe babes from comming to him, were thus? Yee do very evill to hinder thoſe babes from comming now to me for my bleſſing (like them in like caſe) becauſe they (and others like them) ſhould rather come when they are more grown up, when they know mee, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (and not as now their parents onely) can aske and deſire it at my hands, &amp;c. But why then are theſe Diſciples rebuked for ſeeking to put by their comming ſo young, and not themſelves deſiring to come? nay then verily the Diſciples rather were in the right, which would have had them ſtaid longer, and not Chriſt which urgeth it as an argument for comming at that time, and accordingly at that time fulfilleth the parents deſire in bleſſing of the babes: but none herein ſurely will owne <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Another teſtimony of <hi>Tertullians</hi> is urged to confirme the fifth Propoſition, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that <hi>de corona militis.</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">When wee come together to the water, and a little before wee doe promiſe there in the hand of the Miniſter, that wee will renounce the Devill and his pompe, and bee ducked three times, and ſay no more thereto then what the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the Goſpel; and as we goe out of the water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are baptized, we eat milke and hony together, and refraine that whole weeke from waſhing and bathing.</q> So far in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, but the Authors leave out what followeth, <hi>ibid.</hi>

Yea, that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Tertullians</hi> argument there) baptizing of infants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out requiring from them perſonall confeſſion of faith, was a right uſe of the inſtitution. Yea I wonder the Treatiſe bringeth this Teſtimony to prove the right uſe of baptiſme according to Chriſt and his Apoſtles: what were thoſe oblations for the dead by the perſons baptized, and thoſe ſuperſtitious croſſings, forbearing of waſhings and ſpeech, eating milke and honey, &amp;c. were theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

Aſſemble the Congregation, gather ſuch as ſuck the breaſts, &amp;c. children then are upon Scripture grounds, as well as common reaſon, parts of the Church Aſſemblies: nay hath not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> made a rod for his owne back, ſince the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly being divided onely into thoſe three parts, and Scripture, and reaſon, making little ones part of the Aſſembly, and yet neither hearers, nor Catechumens (as reaſon will tell him) therefore they muſt needs bee of the third ſort, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Offerers in thoſe times, they were then in full communion, witneſſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> (as ſome urge it to enſeeble <hi>Cyprians</hi> teſtimony for Paedobaptiſme) and <hi>Cyprian</hi> was above 70. yeeres before the firſt Nicene councell: yea, children were Offerers too in reſpect of that which was offered at their baptiſme, witneſſe the Canon of the <hi>Elebertine</hi> councell, as the little ones of old were ſaid to bring an offering in their hand, when their parents onely did it for them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. but Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> urgeth the ſeventh Canon of the Councell at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> declaring how they Catechiſe them they are to baptize; hee telleth us not what Councell it was, but ſaith it was in <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, ſo it might bee, and yet wee not know by what Character, which it was, divers of them being then called there, <hi>Wolfius</hi> puts <hi>Theodoſius</hi> at <hi>Anno</hi> 383. and <hi>Anno</hi> 382. the third <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> Councell <hi>Anno</hi> 383. the fourth <hi>Anno</hi> 402. the fifth the ſame yeere that the <hi>Milevitan</hi> councell was; and <hi>Anno</hi> 403. the 6, 7, 8. now the 6th. councell of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> provideth that none ſhould have chriſme and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme adminiſtred to them, unleſſe it bee ſuch as firmely hold forth the Lords Prayer, and the Creed, &amp;c. excepting ſuch, who by reaſon of age cannot ſpeake, and provideth, Can. 7. that ſuch as bee witneſſes to Infants in Baptiſme ſhould bee ſound in the faith. Councells uſe not to bee croſſe to themſelves, in ſo little
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41963:136"/> ſpace as to order contrary things, that onely adult perſons ſhould bee baptized, and no Infants, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> expounds them, and yet againe, not onely adult, but Infants ſhall bee baptized, that is not ſquare dealings. And I wonder that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> foreſeeing the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the 46. Canon of that <hi>Laodicean</hi> Councell before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by that at <hi>Trullo</hi> (which was the Emperours Palace, at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, where the Councell uſed to ſit) in <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time, Can. 78. a Councels that was for Paedobaptiſme expreſly, would enfeeble his argument from thence in that a Councell of ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge that Canons eſtabliſhing both this and that, <hi>ſcil.</hi> cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing before baptiſme, and baptiſme before catechiſing, are not contraries, that hee which holdeth the one denyeth the other, but ſubordinate, which may both ſtand together, according as the perſons to bee baptized are either adult or Infants. This Mr. <hi>B.</hi> foreſeeing maketh him (its likely) frame ſuch a poore excuſe, as that its like, upon ſome abuſe or neglect it was reeſtabliſhed by that Councell of <hi>Trullo,</hi> but its like not, rather if it were any thing of the controverſie. Yea, but ſome object the Covenant of <hi>Theodor Balſamon,</hi> and <hi>Zonaras</hi> upon the ſixth Canon of that Grecian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Neoceſarea Anno.</hi> 315. concerning a woman with child, that ſhee ought to bee illuminated (or baptized) when ſhee deſireth it, becauſe in that matter (<hi>ſcil.</hi> of baptiſme) ſhee that brings forth hath nothing in common with the babe which is brought forth, which may bee ſhewed in confeſſion, that it is <hi>proprium uniuſcujuſque inſtitutum, ac propoſitum;</hi> which they are brought in as ſo expounding, or rather inferring thence, that an Infant might not bee baptized, becauſe it hath not power to chooſe the confeſſion of divine Baptiſme. <hi>Zonaras</hi> I have not, but I looked upon that Patriarch of <hi>Antioch, Theodor Balſamon,</hi> who hath theſe words in his <hi>Scholia</hi> upon that Canon. Some (in the councell) ſaid that women with child which came from the Infidels, to joyn with the Church ought not to bee baptized, but to ſtay till the babe they went with were brought forth, leſt that when ſhee were baptized, it might ſeeme that the child in her wombe was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with her, as being altogether united to her; whence it will come to paſſe, that after the babe is borne, either it may bee not left unenlightned (or unbaptized) or if it bee baptized, it may bee thought that it is rebaptized. This hee maketh the occaſion of the Law of that antient, not Latine, but Greeke councell; which was a good while before the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41963:137"/> And it is very remarkable what was the occaſion, it was dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is evident. 1. That they might avoyd the miſchiefe of leaving babes unbaptized. 2. That they might avoyd the other of rebaptizing; two grand hinges of Anabaptiſme: theſe were ſuch miſchiefes (as it ſeemes) in their eyes, that they would not have expreſſions, let fall by them, that might any way occaſion the ſame, ſo that both theſe in thoſe times were rather <hi>inter borrenda</hi> then <hi>recipienda.</hi> But let us heare what <hi>Balſamon</hi> addeth further there, ſpeaking of ſuch Infants, that they could not make promiſe, &amp;c. for how it is with the babe in the wombe none can enquire, nor be ſuretie for them (ſaith he) but Infants (<hi>ſcil.</hi> that are borne) doe affirme by thoſe which are their ſuſceptors, and are accounted to bee actually enlightned (or baptized) with divine illuſtration, or divine baptiſme, they then accounted baptiſme of Infants no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian baptiſme (as the Authors of this Treatiſe, and (as <hi>John Spilsbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> and <hi>Henry Denne</hi> doe) but divine Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the Baptiſme of the Lord, wherefore I conclude that this teſtimony is groſly abuſed by <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41963:137"/> the growne perſon: at length at the full time, after the full of the moone in the ſolemnitie at the holy Font, repeating the ſymboll with full beleefe: It (<hi>ſcil.</hi> the off-ſpring of the Church) did die, and riſe againe with Chriſt, but after Chriſtianitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and that net of the Goſpell was filled with Fiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it was dangerous to delay ſo great a multitude by reaſon of the caſualtie of death, which in a multitude of men is manifold; eſpecially in regard of a company of Infants of Chriſtian Parents, much encreaſing, whoſe tender life is very oft by a ſmall occaſion cut off; it ſeemed good to the holy Church: leave off baptiſme being granted every where, yea, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to prevent all dangers; and yet in a few to celebrate the ſolemnitie of baptiſme, with the reſurrection of the Lord, to which it is like, &amp;c.</q> by this that hath been ſaid, that which the Treatiſe, and <hi>A. R.</hi> intend to diſprove is rather confirmed, and the guilefull wreſting of the teſtimony diſcovered; for beſides what hath been before ſhewed, that Infants baptiſme was before this cuſtome of baptiſme at Eaſter and Penteceſt came up, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe whilſt it was held up, Infants being then, and there bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as well as at other times, as by <hi>Auſtins</hi> teſtimony, <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>ad Neoph.</hi> appeared, this teſtimony alſo tells us, 1 That baptiſme of all ſorts of perſons, in caſe of weakeneſſe and danger, at other times was in uſe of old. 2 That ſucklings as well as growne ones were accounted under the notion of the off-ſpring of the Church, begotten by the word, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in their parents, which being begotten thereby, in their right alſo their children were in churched with them. 3 Confeſſion of faith with full beleefe by others in ſtead of ſucklings, was counted as their confeſſion; the <hi>lactati,</hi> as well as the <hi>grandeſcentes</hi> are ſaid to make ſuch confeſſion of faith, which they could not doe, but by others. 4 That there were preſent at this ſolemnitie a multitude of Infants, as well as growne ones, which did Sacramentally die, and riſe with Chriſt of old. 5 That they baptized not of old all ſorts of children at ſuch times, but onely the Infants of Chriſtians, and that upon the grounds of mortalitie and other weakeneſſe, and hazzard, was there made a change as well in reſpect of the growne part of the multitude, as the Infants onely. 6 That the change that was made upon the grounds of mortalitie, and increaſe of the multitude, was not in reſpect of the ſubjects; that afterwards Infants ſhould bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, whereas onely growne ones before were baptized (for both
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41963:138"/> ſorts were before and after that cuſtome came up, baptized as wee proved) but it was onely in reſpect of the place where, and ſeaſon when, that whereas of old they uſed to come to ſome one great Citie, and that at theſe ſeaſons of yeare onely; now <hi>paſſim</hi> every where, and at any other time they might bee baptized, onely ſome few that were borne a little before theſe ſolemne times, (as <hi>Rupertus</hi> in his other bookes mentioneth) were reſerved to bee then baptized, to grace as it were the ſolemnitie. And this may fully anſwer that teſtimony which this Treatiſe Propoſition 7. and <hi>A. R.</hi> alſo urge out of <hi>Joannes Beemius de moribus Gentium</hi> ſpeaking to like purpoſe.

Propoſition, hee is ſaid to affirme that there is no plaine word in Scripture whereby childrens baptiſme is commanded: his meaning is no more then thus; that it is not in ſo many words ſaid, you ſhall baptize children, as, neither the firſt day of the weeke ſhall bee to you the Lords day, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath, &amp;c. but the principall place, (and for the other two quotations, they are to no purpoſe) is that mentioned in his booke of Articles, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. whoſe words, becauſe the treatiſe is ſo often tripping, wee ſhall ſet downe verbatim, who there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Confirmation ſaith, although I am not ignorant (as it may bee gathered out of the Ancients) <q rend="inline">that of old time Infants were baptized (this is rendred otherwiſe in the Treatiſe) and yet not ſo common as now it is, but the children were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes inſtructed openly, and when their faith had made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon their hearts, and they confeſſed with their mouthes, then they were admitted to baptiſme;</q> this cuſtome of teaching I wiſh were uſed, and recalled now [namely that baptiſme being given to Infants, they may bee afterwards taught when they come to age as they are capable of inſtruction from the Word of God] this the Treatiſe leaveth out. <hi>Zwinglius</hi> his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, that the maine in the childs right to baptiſme was the Parents Covenant eſtate, whence the child being federally holy, which elſe had been uncleane, had its maine title to baptiſme, ſo that in caſe both parents were viſibly Pagans, or Idolatrous, &amp;c. they were not to bee baptized, when yet in his time many ſuch were baptized. And thus I take it is that which hee intendeth, that ſince in Ancient times, albeit ſometimes every little children of Infidels, (as may appeare) were baptized, yet not ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as now ſuch like children are baptized promiſcuouſly hand over head, (for which ſome as it appeares by <hi>Beza</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. have pleaded, albeit hee counts it their errour, <hi>ibid.</hi>) and ſince in thoſe times Catechiſing (as it appeareth) of children was too little in uſe; <hi>Zwinglius</hi> maketh that uſe of the Catechiſing of children of old, both of perſons joyned to the Church (which were capable of inſtruction when firſt their parents joyned in Church eſtate) before their baptiſme, which was one ſort of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41963:139"/> children ſo catechiſed, and of the expoſititious children of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans alſo, thoſe children of their Pagan captive or ſlaves, which were another ſort of children catechized before baptiſme: <hi>Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> wiſheth that albeit it were not in his time uſed, as neither before baptiſme to ſuch like children, ſo neither after the baptiſme, neither of ſuch children, nor of others of viſible beleevers, which ought in Infancy to bee baptized: yet now catechizing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might bee in more uſe. Aſſuredly <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was ſtrong for this, that baptiſme of Infants was no practiſe taken up after the Apoſtles, but by the Apoſtles: no bare old cuſtome taken upon humane grounds: but his judgement was directly croſſe to the Propoſition, hee is brought as a witneſſe to, that Chriſt did not inſtitute Infants baptiſme, &amp;c. witneſſe his many arguments from Scripture for it, and his judicious anſwers to the evaſions of the adverſaries, to that truth. And as much may bee ſaid of <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> his companion, who is cited to confirme the 6th. Propoſition; whereas in the firſt and ſecond booke of the Epiſtles of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> they give grounds from Scripture to the contrary. See <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.

                     <p>BUt it will bee here objected, that that cuſtome of ſuſceptors in Infants baptiſme, and the interrogations, and queſtions that were put to them, or others in their ſtead, doth ſhew, that of old none but growne perſons were baptized upon confeſſion of faith, for that when Infants are baptized they muſt alſo make confeſſion by others. I anſwer, if the very uſe of ſuſceptors in baptiſme were an argument of force againſt Infants baptiſme of old, it might as well bee of force againſt the baptiſme of adult perſons too upon the ſame ground, as then in uſe; ſince they alſo had of old their ſuſceptors: when Pagans deſired to be baptized, they had thoſe which inſtructed them before hand, and when they were baptized they preſented them to baptiſme, and undertooke for them alſo. Stories are plentifull in inſtances, that after that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt cuſtome of ſuſceptors in baptiſme came up, adult perſons had ſuſceptors as well as Infants. <hi>Epidophorus</hi> at <hi>Carthage</hi> of the Church of <hi>Fauſty</hi> had the Deacon of the Church to bee his ſuſceptor. <hi>Magdeb. hiſt. cent.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour was ſurety for <hi>Gethes</hi> King of the <hi>Herulians,</hi> when baptized, and divers others the Centuriſts mention as do other Hiſtorian; nor doth it follow becauſe ſuch confeſſions, and anſwers were made by ſuch as brought Infants to bee baptized, that therefore it argues onely adults uſed to bee of old baptized, rather it argues that of old it was the doctrine of the Church, that Infants were baptized prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in others right, which offered them to baptiſme, namely,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41963:141"/> their godly parents, or ſuch as tooke them as their owne adopted children, to bring them up in Gods feare. Hence even after the corrupt and abuſive practiſe of ſuſceptors came up; Stories are not wanting to tell us of Chriſtian parents which were ſuſceptors to their owne children: witneſſe the Story mentioned by <hi>Fabian</hi> in his 5th. book <hi>c.</hi> 114. <hi>Andovera</hi> wife to <hi>Chilpericus</hi> having a little daughter born in her husbands abſence did by the perſwaſions of the Biſhop <hi>Fredegrand</hi> become witneſſe to it her ſelf at its baptiſme. The Centuriſts mention the ſame Story out of <hi>Ganguinus.</hi> Hence alſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 14th. Sermon upon the words of the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of Infants Baptiſme ſaith, if baptiſme profit the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, I demand whom it benefiteth, the beleeving or the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving? but God forbid I ſhould ſay that Infants are not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I have but now diſputed it before.

                     <p>Thus far forth then it was looked at as a doctrine not onely which the Church had in it, but which the Scripture, the rule of truth contained in it: that in the buſineſſe of Baptiſme at leaſt the faith of ſuch as conveyed ſinne to the child, even of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, was in ſtead of its owne perſonall faith, ſo farre as to make its baptiſme valid and beneficiall to it.</p>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41963:144"/> ſecond <hi>Bracarenſian</hi> Councell it is ſaid <hi>Anno</hi> 610. was childrens Baptiſme ordained as a neceſſary thing; ſo that I am at a ſtand. I thought wee ſhould have heard who inſtituted or ordained bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants ſince it is caſt as a myſtery of the man of ſinne in the preface, and made a humane ordinance Propoſit. 7. And it hath ſo many firſt fathers, and ſo many are challenged for beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this pretended Baſtard, that with all the skill I have, I know not at whoſe doore to lay it. If that <hi>Cyprian</hi> were the father of it, then not <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, or the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> or <hi>Milevitane</hi> Councell gathered in his time above 150. yeeres after; If the fifth or ſixth Carthage Councell, then not the ſecond <hi>Bracarenſian</hi> Councell above 200. yeeres after that: If either of theſe, then not <hi>Innocent</hi> the third 600. yeares after the <hi>Bracharenſian</hi> Councell. The like might bee ſaid of the Conſtitutions of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour, which hee mentions. But if the Treatiſe intend that theſe all or any of them did reeſtabliſh Paedobaptiſme; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they were not the Authors of it: wee are agreed. But this proveth not that what they doe ratifie, or becauſe any of them doe anathematize ſuch as deny it as the <hi>Milevitane</hi> Councell did, that therefore it is an humane ordinance. The <hi>Milevitane</hi> Councell in the <hi>Anathema</hi> they pronounce, they mention that as another ground: Of ſuch as deny that Infants derive any origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall guilt of ſinne which needeth expiation by baptiſme, as well as denying that Infants baptiſme is for remiſſion of ſinnes: Now none will ſay, originall guilt in Infants is a meere humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and device without warrant from Scripture, becauſe that Councell anathematizeth ſuch as deny it. Or that becauſe that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ordaines that thoſe that are come to their full growth ſhould bee taught before they were baptized, as well as hee doth order Paedobaptiſme to bee; that therefore the former is an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ordinance. Surely if that ſuch a ratification bee a <hi>formalis ratio</hi> to make the former an humane ordinance, it is as well ſuch in the latter. Wee ſpeake not now in reference to Scripture grounds of the one or of the other, but of the validity of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from decrees of Councells or Emperours or Popes. And this mindeth mee of ſuch like Teſtimony of witneſſes examined a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before. <hi>Caſſander</hi> hee muſt ſay, Paedobaptiſme came in 300. yeeres after Chriſt. <hi>Luther,</hi> that it came in 1000. yeeres before him, <hi>ſcil.</hi> above five hundred yeeres after Chriſt. <hi>Pomeranus</hi> 1200. yeeres before him (who was contemporary with <hi>Luther</hi>) and ſo

Firſt, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> attempts to make the judgement of the Councell invalid becauſe of the weakneſſe of their grounds, and the Errors annexed. Weake grounds. 1 That <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. as if loſt if not baptized, which was alſo an errour. 2 That God is a like father to all — and ſo all to bee baptized as well as any, which was an errour too. 3 That they had onely ſinned in others. Errours alſo then held; that the holy Ghoſt was received by baptiſme, that Infants were to have the Lords Supper in <hi>Epiſt. de Lapſis,</hi> they held ſigning with the Croſſe, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that Originall ſinne was done away by it; that onely bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons eſcaped Damnation, &amp;c. By all which hee would have it evident that no heed is to bee given to <hi>Cyprians</hi> time when there were ſuch groſſe errors about baptiſme. To which I Anſwer, if that the times were ſo groſſe and darke, then no wonder they might hold forth ſuch weake arguments for the truths they held. If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had well traced antiquitie, and ſhould in his reading ſtill keepe this principle by him, to reject all hee reades of as unſound in Authors or councells becauſe of weake grounds they give; hee would ſoone reject the moſt of what many approved Authors
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:41963:145"/> for ſoundneſſe amongſt the antients doe hold forth, and what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny councells have ratified. Hee that would weigh their wild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Scripture, and Allegories and Judaizing notions which oft times they bring, would as well queſtion from thence either baptiſme or the Lords Supper to bee any ordinances now at all to us, as the Sectaries doe. Let us bleſſe God for clearer times, but not deſpiſe any truth from any for the weakneſſe of thoſe earthen veſſels which hold it out to us. You would thinke him too cenſorious it may bee which comming to heare ſome Coblers or Taylours in <hi>England</hi> to preach, who having good Texts and being happily honeſt in the maine, yet make very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple worke of it both in their wild expoſitions of Scriptures, and weak, yea erroneous grounds which they make uſe of to confirme the Text or doctrine truely gathered from it. As for their errours it doth not appeare from all Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s quotations that all the 66. Biſhops held them all, if <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelfe did. But what if <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> adde prayer for the dead to the baptiſme of adult perſons, as in the place quoted <hi>De Corona Militis</hi> before appeared, yea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, croſſing, &amp;c. (as <hi>Criſpin</hi> in his booke of the eſtate of the Church fathereth theſe upon him) yet will it follow that <hi>ergo</hi> baptizing of adult perſons upon confeſſion is no ordinance of God? no you will ſay becauſe the Scripture warrants it; ſo ſay wee it warrants paedobaptiſme. But wee are now without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Scripture upon a Topick place of argument drawne from humane teſtimony. If the errours of the witneſſe to the one makes his teſtimony invalid, then doe the errours of the other. Yea even thoſe errours which <hi>Cyprian</hi> held about doing away ſin by baptiſme, unction and croſſing in it, damnation being loſt without it: the receiving of the ſpirit by baptiſme, &amp;c. they held them in the point of baptiſme indefinitely, whether of growne perſons or others: ſo that Baptiſme of adult perſons for thoſe errours may bee denied as held out in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time in the maine, or any ordinance as well as Paedobaptiſme. And <hi>Cyprians</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is vaine in the one as well as the other, as alſo his Mr. <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was. Yet Mr. B. urgeth in his preface <hi>Cypr. De Baptiſ. Haeret.</hi> for his purpoſe. If hee held that all ſorts ſhould bee baptized, ſo have our fathers held that all ſorts ſhould come to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when yet onely viſible Saints ſhould. Yet the Lords Supper is an ordinance to adult perſons viſibly in Covenant with God and his people, and not ſcandalous, and ſo is baptiſme of Infants
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41963:146"/> of Parents in viſible covenant with God, &amp;c. notwithſtanding the errour ſuperadded, or that other of Infants comming to the Lords Table, &amp;c. As men may ſuperadde to Chriſt the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wood, hay and ſtubble of their owne, which will all bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, yet the foundation remaine pretious and ſupporting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. So men may and have ſuperadded to the ordinance of baptiſme both of adult and Infants, and ſo to that of the Lords Supper and other ordinances much Stubble of their owne vaine ſpirits and mens inventions, yet that hinders not but that ſuch things were in uſe in their Times, and rightly, in reſpect of the maine held out by them; and as ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire wee may and ought to heare them, notwithſtanding their owne errours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> hath another evaſion, as if this Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprianus</hi> to <hi>Fidus</hi> bee upon ſome grounds to bee ſuſpected to bee ſuppoſititious. As 1.

Biſhops. <hi>Anſw.</hi> What wonder if their grounds were ſo weake (if ſo they bee) ſince Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> hath before told us what an evill time <hi>Cyprians</hi> was? and if they were ſo full of errours as hee ſaid before about baptiſme, is it wonder that they are ſo weake in their principles about it? I could anſwer this weake reaſon otherwiſe, but ſince Mr. <hi>B.</hi> giveth us that anſwer, let him take that; and I cannot but minde him of that Councell at <hi>Carthage</hi> a little after which aſſembled to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh rebaptizing of perſons led aſide into hereſies, yet againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the orthodox Churches; but upon what weake gounds let even Mr. <hi>B.</hi> conſider and judge, yet none therefore queſtions whether ever there were ſuch a councell. 3 Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith there is no mention made at what place this Synod met. <hi>Anſ.</hi> As if ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mentioned no Synods and thoſe genuine, but ſuch as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where the councell met is alſo mentioned, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give amongſt others one inſtance, out of <hi>Oſiander</hi> in his <hi>Exit. hiſt. eccleſ. centur.</hi> 4. <hi>li.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 13. where hee citeth out of <hi>Hillary</hi> an orientall orthodox Synode, of Biſhops gathered againſt that <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienſian</hi>

Thus farre Mr. <hi>B.</hi> out of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Then it ſeemes in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time Infants were partakers of the Lords Supper as well as of baptiſm, that birth wherein they had firſt got that which at the heathen

Alſo that teſtimony for it from the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage, viz.</hi> Chap. 6. citeth this Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian ad Fidum;</hi> ſo doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> often not onely in his 28th. Epiſtle to <hi>Jerome,</hi> but Sermon the 14. upon the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſo in his firſt booke <hi>de pecc. merit. &amp; remiſſ.</hi> and in his third
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41963:148"/> booke alſo <hi>c.</hi> 5. hee citeth that Epiſtle againſt <hi>Pelagius;</hi> verily if there had been any ſuch queſtion imagined in thoſe dayes of the ſpuriouſneſſe of that Epiſtle, <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his followers would ſoon have blunted that weapon as oft as ſharpned againſt them. But ſome will ſay here is juſt the proverb fulfilled, Aske my fellow whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am a theefe. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was as rotten and corrupt in his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples about Paedobaptiſme as was <hi>Cyprian. Cyprian</hi> looked at them as incurring eternall judgement that were not baptized, ſo did hee oft urging <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. 6. 53. hee thought all were to bee baptized whether of beleevers or otherwiſe, ſo did <hi>Auſtin;</hi> hee thought Infants had faith and that becauſe of originall ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, therefore to bee baptized according to that teſtimony of <hi>Origens, Propter hoc, &amp;c.</hi> For this (even becauſe of originall ſinne) they muſt be baptized, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer as before, admit <hi>Auſtin</hi> held out that upon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt grounds, ſo did he hold the adminiſtration of Baptiſme to adult perſons upon grounds of neceſſitie thereof to ſalvation and purging away ſin, yea &amp; the Lords Supper too as ſo neceſſary to growne perſons (<hi>John</hi> 6. 53.) alſo, yet none will make theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances therefore nullities or no ordinances; truth is no leſſe truth, becauſe a weake ſcholler taketh unſafe mediums to confirme or prove the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Yet I adde two things, 1. That the authors urged by Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts uſe like language and argument. <hi>Juſtine</hi> calleth it new birth, and ſaith wee bring them to the water and they are New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne as wee are, that is baptized, (and <hi>per hoc lavacrum remiſſionem peccatorum praeteritorum adipiſcamur, fiamus filii ſcientiae</hi>) and that wee become the ſonnes of knowledge and obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes paſt by baptiſme, &amp;c. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> calls it a waſhing whereby wee wipe away our ſinnes, grace whereby the puniſhments due to our ſinnes are forgiven <hi>paedag. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> calls it baptiſme, becauſe ſinne is buried in the water: ſo he calls it the key of heaven, the caſting away of the fleſh, the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our bonds, the taking away of ſlavery, &amp;c. in his 40. <hi>orat. de baptiſmo:</hi> So <hi>Baſil,</hi> yea theſe authors uſe like grounds for baptiſme. <hi>Juſtine</hi> uſeth that from the neceſſitie of it from <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. and this hee ſpeaking of baptiſme addes. <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Rationem ejus rei hanc accepimus ab Apoſtolis: Quoniam prima nativitas, &amp;c.</hi> Wee have received from the Apoſtles, this as a reaſon of this thing; becauſe that our firſt nativity (<hi>ſcil.</hi> native corruption) commeth

                        <hi>Juſtine</hi> and thoſe with him lived not in the Apoſtles times, yet he received this he ſaith from them that is delivered by them to others after them, and from thoſe others to them. And what reaſon is that delivered thus as a ground of baptiſme? even that native eſtate of children in their parents. What is this but in effect what the author of thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies on the <hi>Romans</hi> urgeth, ſpeaking of <hi>Davids</hi> being conceived in ſinne, &amp;c. <q rend="inline">

                        </q> and the ſame is uſed by <hi>Origen, hom.</hi> 14. on <hi>Luke</hi> by <hi>Cyprian</hi> Epiſtle <hi>ad Fidum,</hi> by <hi>Auſtin, Jerom, Ambroſe.</hi> The ſame uſed by <hi>Gregory orat. de baptiſmo,</hi> thou (<hi>ſcil.</hi> art to haſt to baptiſme) as being in danger if not more but from hence: being borne onely in corruption or in ſinne. The ſame urgeth the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Councell. <hi>Tertullian de baptiſmo</hi> urgeth <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. for baptiſme alſo. So as <hi>Auſtin</hi> and others urge it upon the ground of danger to unbaptized perſons; ſo doth <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, orat.</hi> 40. not to ſtay to Chriſts yeares becauſe of danger of mortality. Yea better Infants bee ſealed without ſenſe thereof, then die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſeale. And hee alſo as well as <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying without baptiſme to bee puniſhed with <hi>paena damni</hi> albeit not with <hi>paena ſenſus, ibid.
